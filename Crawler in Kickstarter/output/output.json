                "Title": "UDOO KEY: The Flexible AI Platform, From $4",
                "Text": "Today, AI is all about algorithms running on remote servers. But it can be so much more. AI could be embedded in our everyday objects and truly change our daily life.That’s where the UDOO KEY comes in. The UDOO KEY is a fully programmable Raspberry Pi RP2040 + ESP32 microcontroller with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy. It’s more than just a piece of hardware: it also gives you access to our AI platform, Clea, with pre-trained AI models to deploy your AI app in minutes.And all this at a once-in-a-lifetime starting price of $4. In short, it gives you access to a new era of micro-computing. Not so long ago, microcontrollers were single-purpose devices. Not anymore with UDOO KEY! Physical programming and do-it-yourself electronics. Fleet management. IoT analytics, over-the-air updates. Telemetry. AI. Just imagine.The UDOO KEY allows you to use either RP2040, ESP32, or both, building your AI projects on your own terms. And most importantly, both MCUs are of the highest quality.The best part about it? Breadth of choice. The Pico-compatible part is built upon a Raspberry Pi RP2040 dual ARM Cortex-M0, with a QSPI 8MB Flash, a 133MHz clock and 264KB of on-chip SRAM. The UDOO KEY’s ESP32, an ESP32-WROVER-E, is based on a dual-core Xtensa 32-bit LX6, with a 16MB flash memory, an 8MB PSRAM, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and BLE.Mind you: the ESP32 on board is not just a Wi-Fi, BT & BLE module. On the contrary, it gives you full access to the firmware of ESP32 and you can program it as you please. The two microcontrollers can talk to each other via serial port. And that's not all. The two modules can also communicate via SWD interface.You can program the board via USB-C and decide whether to talk with Raspberry Pi or ESP32 via jumper. Since the ESP32 does not naturally mount a USB port, we implemented a UART-to-USB bridge. Both microcontrollers can be programmed using different environments, such as TinyML, TensorFlow Lite, MicroPython, C/C++, and many more, giving you plenty of options to streamline your AI application.From the ground up, the UDOO KEY is designed by developers for developers, and it comes built-in with all the tools to make development as smooth as possible. The microcontroller comes with a dedicated, fully open-source firmware based on Free RTOS and with ready to use SDKs to make it as simple as possible to build your next big thing.UDOO KEY is designed to natively support Clea.Clea is an extensible AI & IoT platform.It allows to gather and manage data from connected devices and create flows tailored to the user's needs. It also provides visualization tools to turn IoT data into actionable insights.The platform is based on apps and an SDK that allow developer to quickly embed models pre-built by SECO Mind. Each model is optimized for UDOO KEY and Edge devices, either Arm or x86, with a tuned interface engine depending on the hardware.Clea is built on top of two open-source projects we maintain: Astarte and Edgehog. Astarte allows the developers to manage and process IoT data: from collection to processing up to data orchestration. It features a full-fledged SDK for ESP32 based on the Espressif IoT Development Framework (ESP-IDF), so you can be productive with UDOO KEY and Clea in a matter of minutes and with just a few lines of code.Edgehog enables fleet device management and OTA updates, enhancing ESP32's firmware with a full-fledged device lifecycle solution. We're in the process of making Edgehog available entirely Open Source, so watch this page for updates!We believe that the key to unlock the power of Edge AI is the app model. The smartphone is so easy to use because of the multitouch user interface. But what made it so powerful was the possibility to download an app for every task. The very same model can be replicated with AI.Let’s say you need a face recognition application. That very same app has probably been written countless times before by thousands of developers worldwide.Imagine now being able to deploy a pre-built hardware-optimized version of this app on your devices - your UDOO KEYs, for instance.That’s what we are building. No need to reinvent the wheel every time. Finally, AI becomes a platform.Predictive maintenance is the capability to measure the lifetime of an object and detect a malfunction before it happens. It does so by analyzing data from connected devices through machine learning algorithms.In the video, a predictive maintenance AI model is used to predict a possible malfunction of the fork due to excessive strength.This project employs two UDOO KEY components:Mind you: the smart bike is just an example of predictive maintenance with UDOO KEY.A predictive maintenance AI model can be used in countless industrial and non-industrial scenarios for LCA and to reduce downtime.Sound recognition is the capability to identify a specific sound. In the video, sound recognition is used to identify a bird from the noise it makes.This project employs the following UDOO KEY components:Remember: this is just an example of a sound recognition application. You can use UDOO KEY to test your sound recognition AI model in several industrial and non industrial scenarios or use our own. Have you ever desired to get a coffee just with the power of your voice? Now, you can.This voice-activated coffee machine is the evolution of an old project of ours, UDOO Coffee Machine, and also takes inspiration from several Arduino Coffee Machines you can find online.The concept is simple: you activate the coffee machine by spelling a command word - in this example, “Hey UDOO.” After that, the coffee machine asks a scripted question to confirm that you really want a coffee. If you confirm, coffee is coming!This project employs the following UDOO KEY components:Please note that this voice-activated coffee machine is just an example of keyword recognition with UDOO KEY.Clea and UDOO KEY gives you everything you need to test your own keyword recognition AI model or use our own, which you can apply to hundreds of industrial and everyday scenarios.Here is an example of object detection & classification made with UDOO KEY.In this scenario, UDOO KEY gives your trash bins superpowers. Thanks to UDOO KEY, your trash bin can:Basically, this is a combination of several open-source projects. Specifically:This project employs the following UDOO KEY components:Gesture recognition is the capability to detect a specific gesture.In the video, a UDOO KEY is inserted inside a toy to turn it into a magic wand, giving it new abilities, such as:All of these abilities are gesture-activated thanks to UDOO KEY’s 9-axis IMU.This project employs the following UDOO KEY components:Note: this is just an example of gesture recognition with UDOO KEY. Thanks to UDOO KEY, you can easily run your gesture recognition AI model or use our own.Face recognition is the capability to detect and identify a face in a stream. Although UDOO KEY does not feature a camera, it mounts a camera connector and is compatible with Arducam.There are several face recognition projects you can make with UDOO KEY, both in industrial and non-industrial scenarios, using our own AI model or one made by you. We built the UDOO KEY to empower you.If you are a developer that wants full control with no bells and whistles, then the UDOO KEY Basic is for you: it mounts no sensors, so as to let you expand it with your favorite modules. Otherwise, pick the UDOO KEY PRO.The UDOO KEY PRO mounts two powerful sensors: a 9-axis IMU and a digital microphone. It is ready to let you start with your AI project right away.The 9-axis IMU sensor combines an accelerometer, a magnetometer and a gyroscope in a single module to streamline a wide array of projects, from robotics and RC cars up to smart bikes and automation. It is connected to the ESP32 via I2C bus. You can decide whether to access the I2C bus via ESP32 or RP2040 through the jumper switch.The digital microphone, on the other hand, is designed for AI-powered sound & voice recognition as well as audio control a-la Alexa. It is connected to the ESP32 via I2S bus.The UDOO KEY gives you plenty of options when it comes to interfaces.First thing first, it features three LEDs - one blue, one yellow and one green. The blue one signals a successful connection to Clea, the second one is for Wi-Fi/BT activities, and it's managed by ESP32's IO33 (pin #9). The green one is connected to RP2040's GPIO25. All LEDs are fully programmable.In terms of interfaces, you can use UDOO KEY the very same way you'd use Raspberry Pi Pico and ESP32.Last but not least, the UEXT connector is accessible from the ESP32, which exposes the I2C, UART and SPI interfaces.We built the UDOO KEY to empower you. If you are an embedded developer that wants full control and a minimal set of sensors, then the UDOO KEY Basic is for you: it mounts no sensors, so as to let you expand it with your favorite module. Otherwise, pick the UDOO KEY PRO.In terms of pinout, the UDOO KEY is 100% compatible with Raspberry Pi Pico, both hardware and software-wise.Mind you: all interfaces have ESD protection and are designed to be used not just by hobbyists, but also in industrial environments.Thanks to the ESP32 on board, you get full WiFi 802.11b/g/n connectivity, Bluetooth® and BLE v4.2.The UDOO KEY needs 5V of power via USB-C and consumes very little.The cool thing is, the board can go into deep sleep, reducing the power consumption to a minimum. In this state it only awakes if triggered by a specific event, enabling scenarios where you need the board to function for several years.The UDOO KEY can be powered via battery pack.In fact, it also supports a battery!The UDOO KEY is compatible with Raspberry Pi Pico, both hardware and software-wise. This means that each and any expansion hardware as well as each and any software built for Raspberry Pi Pico will work out of the box on UDOO KEY.ESP32 is an incredibly versatile platform for Edge AI applications. It gives you lots of tools, demos and projects to start - and that's why we chose it.The UDOO KEY opens the doors to Edge AI. Python, MicroPython, TinyML, TensorFlow Lite and much more: the sky's the limit.We love Arduino. In fact, we made UDOO KEY 100% compatible with Arduino software-wise.Yes: UDOO KEY’s Arduino IDE runs the Arduino IDE natively.This means that each and any project that runs on Arduino Nano you can also run on UDOO KEY.We are strong believers and supporters of open-source technologies. Because of this, we are going to release the BOM and schematics of UDOO KEY as soon as we start shipping.This is not an empty promise. We have already released the BOM and schematics of each and every UDOO board - have a look at our website.On top of this, the core components of Clea are already open source:Last but not least, we commit to open-source more Clea components in the future.To make UDOO KEY even more flexible we are making available three special kits.The first one is Early Bird UDOO KEY PRO Cam Kit + Clea.Made in collaboration with Arducam, it includes:The second kit is Early Bird UDOO KEY PRO Grove Kit + Clea.Made in collaboration with SeeedStudio, it includes:The third kit is Early Bird UDOO KEY PRO AI VISION KIT.Made in collaboration with Arducam, it includes:UDOO VISION X5 is the perfect companion for UDOO KEY.It’s a powerful x86 single-board computer based on an Intel® Atom® X5-E3940 Quad Core. The board is built upon a Pico-ITX pocket-size form factor, the ideal platform for computer vision projects. It features a 32-bit Quad-Channel LPDDR4 soldered on-board, 4GB of RAM and 32GB of eMMC.What’s more, UDOO KEY is natively compatible with Clea and unlike other development boards, UDOO VISION X5 natively runs OpenVINO™, a toolkit by Intel to quickly deploy computer vision and AI/ML apps at the edge.This is not our first rodeo.We’ve already launched 4 successful Kickstarter campaigns - UDOO, UDOO NEO, UDOO X86, UDOO BOLT - raising over 2 million dollars from thousands of backers worldwide.Since the very first UDOO board we’ve shipped over 100,000 single-board computers.With UDOO DUAL/QUAD, our first single board computer launched on Kickstarter in 2013, we created a new playground for students to learn the basics of coding, electronics and physical computing with an all-in-one solution.With UDOO NEO, our second single board computer launched on Kickstarter in 2015, we empowered makers, designers, startups and research groups all over the world with an IoT-ready all-in-one device for applications using motion sensors (rovers, drones, robots, automation).With UDOO X86, launched on Kickstarter in 2016, we created the most powerful single board computer of the time. UDOO X86 addresses the needs of the average consumer that is looking for a very good, affordable media player, but also speaks to developers, makers and startups who want to invent today the world of tomorrow. With UDOO BOLT, launched on Kickstarter in 2018, we created a portable and powerful computer featuring an AMD Ryzen™️ Embedded V1000 SoC and an Arduino™️-compatible platform, all wrapped into one.UDOO is a joint effort of SECO Edge and SECO Mind, both daughter companies of SECO.SECO is a public company and a leading international player in the B2B embedded market.

                "Title": "UNLEASHED '22: Timelapse, Long Exposure, Remote & Geotagging",
                "Text": "The Unleashed is the swiss army knife of camera accessories: It’s tiny, but packed with features. So much more than just a camera remote, it unleashes the full potential of your camera with expert level timelapse features, long exposure capabilities, geotagging and more - in a tiny Bluetooth module and an intuitive app that simply works.Since our last Kickstarter campaign, we've shipped the Unleashed ’18 to thousands of happy customers all over the world. Now, by popular demand, we're launching the new Unleashed ’22, finally supporting nearly all mirrorless cameras as well as DSLRs: Sony, Fujifilm, Panasonic, Canon and Nikon! We designed the Unleashed to be incredibly smart in the tiniest package. With its low profile design, it's never in your way and you can leave it on your camera at all times - even when packing it in your bag. Thanks to Bluetooth Low Energy, initial pairing takes less than 10 seconds and reconnection is almost instant when you turn on the camera or open the app. It only uses a minimal amount of power from your camera battery, so you don't need to charge it, and it's always ready when you need it! Our beautiful app is just the user interface for the Unleashed, whereas the brains are in the tiny device itself. This means it will keep controlling the camera to finish your shot, even if you close the app, you walk out of range or your phone battery dies.The Unleashed gives you full control over your camera from the palm of your hand and adds a ton of features to your camera – easy to use from our app.The Unleashed enables you to easily take pro-level selfies, breathtaking astro photos, creative light-paintings and epic \"holy grail\" timelapses.The Unleashed ‘18 is already loved by thousands of customers, achieving beautiful results that continue to blow us away. This gave us a solid foundation to build on, and we took all your feedback and wishes to heart.So for the new Unleashed ‘22, we reworked every aspect of our firmware and much of our app, further improving speed and reliability. And of course we added some great new features to make it the perfect all-round tool for any photographer!IN OUR CUSTOMERS’ WORDS“Unleashed has changed my life. I have two, one for each Z7, use them to about 10% of their potential and they’re still game-changing.” - Josh H.“I have been taking pictures for about 50 years and have seen and tried many technical solutions for remote control of cameras. This solution from Germany is so far the most sophisticated, elegant and at an unbeatable price I have found.” - Blue Reef“This technology for camera control is amazing and so small. It puts all others practically out of the picture (no pun intended).” - Dr. Stephen L.Because it can always stay on your camera and is never out of battery, the Unleashed is the perfect remote control, be it for simple triggering of tripod shots, family photos or selfies. Or use it to remotely start & stop video recording - when your camera is mounted on a gimbal or you want to start multiple cameras at once. The Unleashed app can handle up to 6 cameras with ease.But it’s so much more than just a remote - with the Unleashed you can change all the important settings of your camera, without having to touch your camera or dig through daunting menus.We’ve all come to love geotagged photos on our smartphones, where you can easily find photos on a map in the “places” album, as well as check the exact location of individual shots. The Unleashed enables direct in-camera geotagging for your mirrorless camera or DSLR, using either your smartphone’s location or a dedicated Bluetooth GPS receiver.Astrophotography, lightpainting and moreOur long exposure feature helps you take perfectly timed exposures up to 4.5 hours. When the camera is set to bulb mode, the Unleashed will hold the trigger down for you for the exact time you want it to. Or you can press once to start and press again to stop a long exposure of any length. We decided on continuing the scale of 1/3rd stop steps from the camera instead of you having to set hours, minutes and seconds separately. While it’s unconventional, this makes it much easier to work with the other exposure settings in the camera: Take test shots with high ISO to nail exposure, then decrease ISO and easily increase exposure time by an equal number of stops to keep the same exposure level.  ND filter photographyWe also added a setting that will adjust the shutter speed for you by the right number of stops when adding or removing ND filters, making ND filter calculators obsolete! The Unleashed makes setting up any timelapse a breeze, whether simple or requiring expert features. And we implemented lots of them!Just use our default settings and hit start or choose your interval and shooting time - it’s that easy! We’ll show you the number of photos it’ll take, as well as the resulting clip length at your chosen frame rate. You can also decide to choose the number of photos to take, and we’ll calculate the shooting time for you instead.Real exposure ramping The Unleashed brings “holy grail” timelapses within reach for everyone. During these day-to-night transition timelapses, the Unleashed will adjust exposure settings automatically, using one of several algorithms to choose from. We’re not limited to bulb-ramping, but can actually ramp the camera’s shutterspeed, aperture and ISO for daylight to milkyway transitions. Minimized dark-timeAll normal intervalometers have unnecessarily long autofocussing and hold times. The former is how long the shutter button is half-pressed before the interval, the latter how long it is fully pressed and held on each interval. These times need to be long enough to ensure a photo is taken, with or without AF. So to be on the safe side, intervalometers usually half-press, then press and hold for way too long. This results in unwanted “dark-time” between shots where nothing useful happens, but you also can’t view the photos. Some more advanced intervalometers allow you to change the hold time, but this puts the burden on you to find the shortest possible but longest necessary time that will consistently work with your camera. The Unleashed knows whether the camera is set to autofocus, and on most cameras it gets the info exactly when the shutter opens. So it will only half-press when necessary and can stop holding the shutter button the instant we know the camera started the shot, leading to the absolute minimal dark-time for every camera, with no configuration necessary. Flexible intervalsSo you don’t miss any shots when exposure times get longer, the Unleashed can optionally start increasing the interval. This is perfect for day-to-night timelapses as it enables you to have a nice short interval during the day, but still allows ramping down to 30s exposures for starry nights.Month-long durationsYou can now set intervals of up to 24h and shooting times up to 365 days! External intervalometer supportOur autoramping will optionally work with external intervalometers, even sliders and other motion controllers.Sync timelapses with the movement of motion controllersBecause the Unleashed knows exactly when a shot ends, it can tell motion controllers to move with perfect timing, in order to maximise the time until the next shot and therefore minimize vibrations. This will work wirelessly with selected manufacturers. We have already implemented support for the Black Forest Motion PINE controllers and are currently working on Syrp compatibility, with more to follow. With most cameras it will also work with a wired shutter cable from any other motion controller and the Unleashed set to external intervalometer.Foolproof and fail-safeAll basic and advanced features are implemented in the Unleashed firmware, and the app just provides the user interface to configure them. Once started, the Unleashed keeps controlling the camera with precision and without missing a beat, even if you lose Bluetooth connectivity. Precise timing, complex \"holy grail\" calculations and camera adjustments are handled by the Unleashed itself, not the app! Even the Bluetooth connection to a motion controller is direct and independent from the smartphone. Of course you can open the app and reconnect at any time to see the current progress or make manual adjustments.Gallery and photo review - now in HDThe new Unleashed got 10x faster. So you can now transfer high-resolution preview images to your phone! You can enable automatic downloading for quick review after each shot you take, and you can browse all photos in our new gallery view. The Unleashed quickly loads all thumbnails and you can choose to download your favorites in higher resolutions individually. To get the most out of the Bluetooth bandwidth, we added smart comparison algorithms to avoid unnecessary data transfers. We even implemented complex methods to add the EXIF data of the original image to the high-resolution previews you’re downloading! Because your GPS metadata along with all other shooting info is in the preview images when you save those to your camera roll, you’ll be able to see and search for those photos conveniently on a map in your “Places” album.Share on locationEasily share your favorite shots taken with your camera right from our app. The new high resolution previews are perfect for sharing on Social Media or with your family and friends right on the spot.We have a loooong wish list of our customers’ feature wishes for the Unleashed and our app. Reaching the following funding goals will enable us to develop some of these requests. So spread the news, tell your friends and together we’ll make these cool features become a reality!Note that the last two stretch goals don’t guarantee we will be able to provide full support for all features on these camera brands! We still have too much R&D ahead of us to promise this. Also, as already written elsewhere, we only have a chance to support these Olympus cameras: OM-D E-M1 III, E-M5 III, E-M1X and E-M1 Mark II and these Pentax cameras: 645Z, K1, K1 Mark II and maybe the K3, KP and K3 Mark II. You can read the reasoning behind that in our FAQs.Extended exposure bracketing.When we say extended, we mean it. With the Unleashed, you can take exposure bracketed shots with up to 55 images and any EV stepsize: 0.3, 0.7, 1.0, 2.0… you name it. Set up your starting exposure, and select whether you want symmetric bracketing, only darker exposures, or just brighter exposures. Choose whether to bracket exposure by changing shutterspeed, aperture or ISO - or any combination thereof, in the order you choose! Set maximum and minimum for each of these settings, to keep your bracketed shots shorter, avoid noise or limit depth of field variation and diffraction. You have full control!Capture scenes with high dynamic range to create HDR photos with tone mapping or exposure fusion. Or use it for image-based lighting of 3D renderings to realistically place 3D objects into the real world.The new Unleashed '22 is compatible with 144 camera models. To fit all those different cameras, there will be 7 different Unleashed models, as well as 7 different cables to perfectly and snugly fit on your camera. Each Unleashed model is a mere 14x16x5.5mm in size (0.54 x 0.63 x 0.20 in, w x h x d, without the plug) and weighs less than 5g. The cables are custom made with extremely flexible wires and the smallest possible right-angled plugs to make sure they never get in your way.To make it easier, all we need to know is which camera you want the Unleashed for, and we’ll make sure you get the right Unleashed + cable combination. Just back this project and pledge to support us today, and a few weeks before shipping we’ll send you a survey through our pledge manager where you can specify your camera along with shipping details to get your reward. The following cameras are supported. Having covered all bases, we’re sure one of our Unleashed models will fit any new camera coming to market.Sony Alpha: α7 IV, ZV-E10, α1, α7S III, ZV-1, α9 II, α6100, α6600, RX100 VII, α7R IV, RX0 II, α6400, RX100 VA, RX100 VI, α7 III, α7R III, RX10 IV, RX0, α9, α6500, α99 IIFujifilm: GFX 100S, X-S10, X-T4, GFX 100, X-T3, X-H1, GFX 50S, X-T2, X-T1 IR, X-T1, IS Pro, S5 ProPanasonic Lumix: DC-GH6, DC-GH5 II, DC-S5, DC-S1H, DC-S1, DC-S1R, DC-GH5S, DC-G9, DC-GH5Canon EOS: R3, R5, R6, 850D / Rebel T8i, 1D X Mark III, Ra, 90D, M6 Mark II, 250D / Rebel SL3 / Kiss X10, RP, R, 2000D / 1500D / Rebel T7 / Kiss X90, 4000D, 6D Mark II, 200D / Rebel SL2 / Kiss X9, 77D / 9000D, 800D / Rebel T7i / Kiss X9i, 5D Mark IV, 1300D / Rebel T6, 80D, 1D X Mark II, 5Ds, 5Ds R, 760D / Rebel T6s / 8000D, 750D / Rebel T6i / Kiss X8i, 7D Mark II, 1200D / Rebel T5 / Kiss X70, 70D, 100D / Rebel SL1, 700D / Rebel T5i / Kiss X7i, 6D, 650D / Rebel T4i / Kiss X6i, 1D C, 60Da, 5D Mark III, 1D X, 600D / Rebel T3i / Kiss X5, 1100D / Rebel T3 / Kiss X50, 60D, 550D / Rebel T2i / Kiss X4, 1D Mark IV, 7D, 500D / Rebel T1i / Kiss X3, 5D Mark II, 50DNikon: Z9, Z fc, Z7 II, Z6 II, Z5, D780, Z50, D6, D3500, Z7, Z6, D850, D7500, D5600, D3400, D5, D500, D7200, D810A, D5500, D750, D810, D4s, D3300, Df, D5300 , D610, D7100, D5200, D600, D3200, D800, D800E, D4, D5100, D7000, D3100, D3S, D300S, D5000, D3X, D90, D700, D3, D300, D2Xs, D200, D2Hs, D2X, D2H.

Check our FAQs for the reasons why.Yes, we know each one of those manufacturers has their own app ... but have you ever used one - and then used it a second time? From our own experience and for the vast majority of people we have talked to, the manufacturers apps are so frustrating to use, that few people will bother making a second attempt of getting the apps to work, let alone use them productively in the field. The biggest gripes everyone has with these apps is getting them to connect to the camera reliably. The Unleashed is the complete opposite: Even initial pairing only takes seconds, and reconnection in every day use happens instantly when you open the app. Check out a real-time comparison between the Unleashed versus the manufacturers' native apps from initial connection to first photo.\"I've used a lot of remote triggers, but the Unleashed is by far my favorite. It's so small and unobtrusive that it nests inside my camera's L-bracket and I love the fact it needs no batteries or charging. The app has an intuitive, modern, well-designed interface. With the latest updates, it's a dream to use for low light remote triggering and complex timelapse. I’m really looking forward to all the features of the new Unleashed.\"\"Shutter release remotes are one of the essential components to sharp night sky images, so naturally I have used a lot of them. Some would call me a destroyer of equipment on the many trips I drag it through, so I’ve jumped from remote to remote for years. Well, since I’ve had the Unleashed that’s changed. Ever since I’ve had it, I haven’t used another remote at all, honestly. The thing just lives on my camera, I don’t think it has left my camera body even once since the day I got it. The greatest part about it is that I no longer have to constantly worry about forgetting to bring a shutter remote, or losing it along the way. I remember the constant stress of bringing batteries or forgetting them on multi day backpacking trips for other remotes. What is great about this remote is it uses your camera’s battery (which I have not noticed any difference in battery life) and now I can just focus on bringing camera batteries and keeping my phone charged which I would be doing anyway! I’ve also used a lot of the standard camera bluetooth apps like nikon's snap bridge and would go as far as to say that I am not alone in disliking them. The interface of the Unleashed app is easy to use and very effective. It’s also so nice to finally have an app that has real usable timelapse functions.\"\"For me, the thing I like about the Unleashed the most might be different than one would think. I love how easily I can use my camera remotely from my phone. I can control/change almost all settings from the palm of my hand. Since I do a lot of astrophotography and long exposure stuff, it really makes that so much easier for me. A lot of times I need to be able to start my camera and do light painting. I can set up a 2 or 10 second delay on my phone, hit start, put my phone in my pocket, wait for it to start taking the picture and do my light painting. It helps a lot more than one would think.It's also very nice to be able to take \"selfies\" with something other than a cell phone when there's not generally people around that can run the camera for you. I have taken many family pictures with it remotely that don't look like they were set up on a tripod. I love the timelapse and holy grail timelapse features as well. I really like that I can see visually what multiple cameras are doing at any time throughout the timelapse too. I think my favorite \"moments\" I have with using them is taking my own astroselfies or self-family pictures. I don't always get the opportunity to be in the pictures because I'm usually the one with the camera taking the pictures. But with The Unleashed I can remotely control them, from a decent distance and even view the images if need be. It makes getting in front of the camera much easier and be part of the memories I'm creating.\"\"Hey all my name is Josh Morgan and I’m a rural electrician from New Zealand with a keen interest on Astro Photography and Timelapse. So I took a punt on the Unleashed in early 2020 to hopefully assist me with my timelapse work. After a long Covid wait it arrived and I couldn’t be more happy with it. Really transformed my D750 into a more modern machine, gave me extended long shutter durations for crazy long exposures, GPS tagging and more importantly full time exposure ramping shutter/aperture/iso for full time holy grail timelapse work which had been a sore point for me as I had to manually ramp every setting during sunset/sunrise which has its own problems if I was tryna run 2 cameras. But also more importantly it runs off Bluetooth which was critical to me as any wifi related systems absolutely chewed up battery life on the camera. So a very welcomed bonus and so far a hell of a product.My favourite moment so far with the Unleashed is it finally allowed me to capture amazing holy grail timelapse work coming into our prime Astro season at my holiday destination of choice Great Barrier Island. What I managed to capture was some of the most intense levels of airglow I’ve ever encountered. I have family/time constraints there so having the Unleashed work hands off was really amazing.\"Foolography GmbH, founded in 2009, is an international team located in Berlin, Germany, making use of the city’s great network and drive for technological innovation. Being engineers and photographers ourselves, we live and breathe our products. The Unleashed is not just another commercial product, it's our baby! We use it all the time and have devoted countless hours refining every detail for the smoothest operation in all edge cases. To do so, we reverse engineered protocols and learned to control every possible bit of the cameras! This translates to a hassle-free user experience which really sets the Unleashed apart. In an update we'll do a tech deep dive with the founder to highlight a few of those. Stay tuned!The Unleashed is made in Germany and is the product of some serious German engineering! Of course some components are sourced abroad, but the Unleashed is designed, developed and manufactured in Germany. We’ve actively been working toward this new Unleashed for the better part of the last two years. In fact, to pave the way for the new features of the Unleashed ‘22, we refactored so much code that we found and fixed quite a few bugs in rare edge cases and made huge improvements to nearly all features of the Unleashed ‘18 along the way. After a long beta testing phase, we just released all these in a major 2.0.0 update of our Apps for iOS and Android including the 2.0.0 Firmware. So not only does the new Unleashed benefit hugely from all the R&D we did on the Unleashed ‘18, the reverse is true as well.One of the most important things we learned from the last campaign: no matter how well you plan, you’ll always need more time! So we're only starting this campaign now that we got the Unleashed fully functional on all new brands. The current lead times for components are making it virtually impossible to promise a shorter delivery time, so we have not just included some buffers into our timeline - basically our entire timeline is buffer! So while we gear up for production and wait for components to arrive, we’ll have all that time to really polish all the new features.After the campaign, a few weeks before we ship the Unleashed, you will get access to our pledge management system (via email) where you can pay for optional express shipping, buy additional Unleasheds or other accessories. Shipping costs are: Germany: 8€, Rest of World: 15€, express shipping can be added optionally.We really appreciate your help in getting word out about the new Unleashed, be it to your photography buddies, your followers on Social Media or a media outlet you happen to work for 😉.

                "Text": "Nowadays, robots are widely used in big factories. They are expensive, large and heavy, they mainly work on heavy-duty tasks. However, few of them are designed for light and budget-friendly tasks. This raises a real challenge in keeping quick ROI in these tasks by using robots. A durable and affordable robot arm with industrial-grade accessories is key.Designed with six axes, Lite 6 is perfect for simple, repetitive and monotonous tasks. It provides the speed and precision manufacturers require, meanwhile ensures quality and accuracy. The flexibility of Lite 6 allows manufacturers to optimize workflow, increase productivity, reduce floor space utilization, lower production costs. Lite 6 helps researchers automate manual tasks and free up time to focus on more significant or pressing tasks. By using Lite 6 in lab automation, accidents and human error can be prevented. And above all, it can be customized easily to meet a lab’s needs.By taking advantage of open source SDKs, robotics research will be much easier. Moreover, in order to make robot integration relatively intuitive and smooth, we are working on ROS/ROS2 seriously.Lite 6 is extremely versatile, it is able to gently test any type of touchscreen without leaving any traces or damage, and helps our clients to provide consumers with flawless products.Lite 6 is lightweight and small, which is perfectly fit for space-saving applications such as robot bar, coffee machine. With a 500mm/s max speed and 1kg payload, it balances the efficiency and cost, especially for commercial applications.Compared with manual loading and unloading, Lite 6 drastically improves uptime. In addition, it's more accurate and repeatable, which increases the quality of parts produced, reduces the amount of human error in the machining process, maximizes throughput, and minimizes wasted materials and time. All new cost-effective actuators. The harmonic drive is a must to guarantee the repeatability of the robot, but it is also very expensive. So Lite 6 has hybrid actuators design to balance the cost and performance. In our design, the harmonic drives are for the high torque joints and direct drive motors are for the rest.Moreover, crafted with carbon fiber, Lite 6 is 50% much lighter than other robots, which significantly helps to increase the payload up to 1kg.Lite 6 is designed for 24/7 continually working. Combined with industrial-grade harmonic drive, actuators can execute the commands day and night without stopping.The built-in 16-bit absolute encoder and FOC control algorithm, the customized brushless motor creates smooth movement, high torque capability, and delivers excellent repeatability.No need to spend additional money on training and software, Lite 6 offers users free software - UFACTORY Studio, even non-specialists can run it in 2 hours. Users can simply drag and drop to program and control it by a graphical user interface, which saves training cost and operation time. Users can teach the robot motions and positions easily and quickly, greatly simplifying robot programming, users can also program Lite 6 with Python, ROS, and C++. In addition, UFACTORY offers a free Simulator, users can try Lite 6 for free before they buy it.Taking advantage of the built-in pump design, the pneumatic gripper works perfectly without external air tubes outside. Equipped with a linear bearing, it provides a stable and smooth grasp all the time.Built-in pump design makes the internal wiring possible. And brushless pump motor enables the long-term lifetime for 24/7 continually working. Moreover, the air pressure sensor gives real-time feedback of pressure which makes drop-off detection possible.Thanks to a variety of I/O and communication interfaces, Lite 6 has excellent compatibility and extensibility, it can be integrated into various applications.Lite 6 is user-friendly and pre-calibrated, which enables users to apply it to any process and in a different setting without professional training.Lite 6 is a slave component rather than a master, thus it can be integrated easily via any computer or PLCCompared to other robot arms in the market, Lite 6 is not only economical but also very excellent in performance.You can also know the differences between Lite 6 and xArm 6. Lite 6 SDK includes Python SDK, ROS/ROS2 SDK, and C++ SDK.

                "Text": "Normally, a laser cutter can perform very well on many materials such as wood, metal and glass. However, for some soft materials such as vinyl, which can be used for DIY T-shirts, sign making, logos and more, a blade cutter is preferable to avoid the burnt edge, discoloration and toxic fumes generated by laser cutting.With xTool M1 which has both the laser and blade heads, you don’t have to waver between a laser cutter or a blade cutter (or breaking the bank to buy both). Your ideas can be realized on just one machine.To achieve adequately strong laser cutting and engraving power at an affordable price, we chose a diode laser instead of CO2 laser.For xTool offical materials, xTool M1 software auto-recognizes materials and recommends default parameters for cutting and engraving accordingly.Now, during our Kickstarter campaign, we are offering the best-ever price of xTool M1 starting from only $699. That is less than 1/5 of Glowforge's price, but still gives you about 80% of the functions of Glowforge Plus + Cricut Maker 3.The Rotary Attachment unlocks 360° engraving for cylindrical objects from 3mm to 70mm in diameter (with the raisers provided), with which you can customize a wide range of cylindrical materials.*If you keep raising the machine, you can engrave objects in larger diameter.Currently, due to worldwide supply chain issues, shipping prices are heavily inflated. To ensure you get the best possible rate, we will charge the shipping fee AFTER the campaign, closer to the shipping date.Our current estimate is that shipping will be around 10%~18% of the order price, including tax & duties for most regions (Around 15%~25% for Australia, New Zealand and Norway). We can promise that the shipping fee we charge will be no more than 18% of most regions (no more than 25% for Australia, New Zealand and Norway), we will cover the excess part if it costs more. Note:The safety class of xTool M1 is Class I (FDA Certified). We are on track to receive FDA/FCC/CE-LVD/EMC certifications before March 2022, which are necessary for delivering our products to the US, EU and most areas in the world.Makeblock got its humble beginnings eight years ago. We launched our first project on Kickstarter, and thanks to the amazing Kickstarter community and our backers, we've been able to grow our business to where it is today - a company with over 300 employees...From \"one robot per child\", our mission never altered. We continue to empower kids to enjoy the fun of creating.This time around, with xTool M1, we want to bring powerful tools to everyone who enjoys doing things themselves. This first-of-its-kind machine is low-barrier, compact, and affordable.The most important thing is not that we're presenting the world's first desktop hybrid laser & blade cutter and engraver, but that we always aimed to \"WOW\" our backers with our products.We’re so grateful for all of your support along the way. Thanks for helping us bring xTool M1 to life.What is xTool?xTool is part of Makeblock, a world-renowned coding robot manufacturer & education solution provider. Our brand’s story started with a lot of love and a little inspiration (“How can we make it easier and safer for kids to enjoy creating?”). The brand concept of xTool was born in 2018 and we launched the first xTool LaserBox in 2019. From there, our mission has been to help people turn their creativity into reality (and have fun doing it)!We are also proud of our industrial design and have won numerous awards.We do not brag about ourselves but enjoy a word-of-mouth reputation.We were named one of  ProductHype's  Best Kickstarter Projects of 2021.This project is boosted by BackerCrew. ",

                "Text": "This is Oumua!Your lightweight and portable breathing trainer designed to increase your endurance, lung performance, and improve your overall well-being in under 10 minutes a day.To preorder and make this breathing perfection a reality, click Back This Project — or read on!Do you also find yourself running out of breath?\n  It might be from a trip up the stairs… an intense workout… or even getting up too fast! No matter our fitness levels, breathing is always one of the biggest factors holding us back. And while traditional breathing practices do work, sessions can be long and may take years to master. On the other hand, the current breathing trainers all share similar problems:Until now… Oumua was born out of the search for the perfect respiratory muscle training device for everyday use.We want you to also benefit from breathing exercises — not just the pro athletes and yoga gurus!Oumua combines a healthy breathing habit, with a perfectly balanced user experience and AI-powered technology - with stunning space-inspired aesthetics. Breathing perfection — at your fingertips.Oumua's separated airflow channels allow for faster-exercising results while helping you avoid common mistakes and respiratory imbalances.Current sports science agrees with breathing practices and traditions dating back thousands of years, that inhalation and exhalation resistance training should be separated, as inspiration and expiration are commonly perceived as two different processes.\n\n   Exercising both inhalation and exhalation at the same time is likely to exacerbate the existing imbalances, causing training overlaps and rollbacks. Oumua was designed with this in mind. \n   Oumua has two separate airflow channels that allow you to perform the inhalation and exhalation movements separately. By gradually tailoring the resistance levels, you’ll progress faster, and avoid common exercising mistakes from other practices.All it takes to gain control of your breathing are 5 to 7 mins of inhalation training in the morning, and 5 to 7 mins of exhalation resistance training in the evening. Experience a noticeable increase in your breathing performance with just these 10 to 15 minutes of daily exercising.Oumua's patent-pending Gradient resistance system guides you through 6 resistance levels, based on your goals, from general well-being to athletic improvement.Nothing should hold you back from strengthening your breathing experience. That’s why a slight recess in the center makes it easy to switch between the resistance levels, even in the dark, for people with low muscle tone, and if you have compromised fine motor skills. Oumua also “clicks” every time you change the resistance level — an intuitive and user-friendly feature for seniors and users with poor eyesight.Oumua provides resistance levels tailored for both general well-being and athletic improvement, starting from moderately low 8 сm (3.14 inches) of H2O resistance - all the way up to really hard-to-crack 60 сm (23.6 inches), something even trained athletes will find challenging.Oumua Pro is the world’s first personal breathing trainer with a dedicated app powered by Artificial Intelligence. By analyzing your parameters such as age, weight, and athletic condition, the app guides you through each training session, giving live suggestions, exercise compliance, and tracking progress online.With Oumua App, you can measure your lung capacity, adjust training sessions based on compliance, get new training programs, and compete with other users during similar training sessions.It tailors resistance levels and gets performance guidance, helping you avoid respiratory imbalances, overlaps, and pullbacks.The breathing training sessions are built on several core principles like periodization (micro/meso/macro cycles), dynamic resistance increase, and AI-guided conditioning. You can choose (and switch) between 3 main areas:Ready to level up your breathing?Pre-order Oumua Pro, and select the color (Belize, Rosewood, Azure, Onyx, Pearl, Shamrock, Indigo and add-on colors Blush and Charcoal) via a backer survey after the campaign ends.Click Back This Project and select your Pledge Tier.Pre-order now and pay when the campaign ends.Oumua exterior is a reference to nature’s phenomenon, the Nautilus Pompilius, whose shell is a perfect representation of the golden spiral.Its minimalist exterior reduces undue attention, and there are no added vibrations, sounds, or sensations — it's handily sized, user-friendly, intuitive and discrete.The name is inspired by Oumuamua — Hawaiian for “first distant messenger” — and the name given to the first known interstellar object to make it into our Solar System. What can we say, we love space :)Resistance modes \"1\" and \"2\" are optimal for the breathing practice novices, seniors, and users with compromised respiratory function; \"3\" and \"4\" offer a moderately challenging training experience that will fit most users; \"5\" and \"6\" are suitable for trained breathing practitioners and athletes.Oumua height is 4.9 inches, the switcher is 1.6 inches wide, the mouthpieces are 0.4 inch; the depth is 0.9 inch. Oumua Pro weighs 2.9 oz.Oumua is engineering and user experience, perfected — it is hand-sized, lightweight, intuitive, user-friendly, and durable.

                "Title": "The Solar System in a Sphere - True to Scale",
                "Text": "Another representation of our Solar System? There are hundreds of books/websites about it and everybody knows our 9 planets and how they are arranged, right? After all, we should have learned that in school...Many of us still remember the mnemonic: \"My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas\" or as we say here in Germany: \"Mein Vater Erklärt Mir Jeden Sonntag Unsere Neun Planeten\".   With this help, many of us can at least list the planets correctly...Mars, Venus, Earth, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, right? Almost! Pluto was assumed to be a planet but does not identify itself as such anymore and Mercury comes before Mars,  but the most crucial fact is:That most of us never understood the true differences in size and distances between the planets, because most representations are not true to scale.With a strong laser, we shoot tiny cracks into the glass. We laser our Sun + 9 Planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, Uranus, and the hypothetical Planet 9 into our famous Spheres. We also want to picture the 9 Moons: Ganymede, Callisto, Io, Europa, Rhea, Titan, Iapetus, Triton, and our Moon Moon (Luna).The Sun in our Sphere will be 4cm, the largest Planet 4mm, and the smallest Moon 0.1mm, which is barely visible to the naked eye and even more difficult for our camera.Not everyone might be a fan of our scaled representation of the Solar System, so we consider offering different versions of it We also want to offer a 9 Planet Cube Set, containing a planet each with a size of 3x3x3cm.You can try to place these small cubes at the right distances to the Solar Sphere, but this might be more difficult than thought. Why?Because although they are so small in our Sphere you can barely see Earth, they would be ridiculously far away. There is probably no one in the world who could throw our Neptune regarding our Sphere onto its Orbit.  Even Saturn is challenging but doable. Challenge accepted? After what felt like eons of searching for a good LED base that is stylish, functional, and affordable, we finally found one. Of course, the bases we've offered so far work flawlessly and even wirelessly, but they lack some features and don't completely light up our models the way I want them to.With the new LED bar, our spheres and small cubes can be illuminated perfectly. You can control it via smartphone and create your own color schemes. You can even pair the LED with any TV so that the colors match the TV program.  I am very delighted.As in our previous campaigns, we would like to present many interesting facts about our models in our updates. Maybe we will also make a small booklet again.For example: Did you know that the ice giants Neptune and Uranus are not cold at all? The atmosphere consists of a hydrogen-methane mixture that becomes a hot fluid due to the enormous pressure. Further inside, phenomena like hail and even whole icebergs of Diamonds are suspected. But then why are they called ice giants?  Find out in our updates!But we also want to write about the habitable zones, the moons, and the immense distance the planets are apart.Within the campaign, we will explain the differences between our planned models and the different shapes and sizes of our products. Even though our Star Constellation Sphere with its 5068 stars and 88 constellations already fits really nicely into the series......the Solar System Sphere with its Sun, Planets, and Moons truly completes our Universe Sphere series. Thus, the individual lasered points symbolize either planets or Moons, Stars, or entire Galaxies, depending on the Sphere.We will design Solar System Coasters and hand them out to our first 1000 backers for free. There will be a set of 2x10 coasters - Our Sun + 9 Planets,  so you can also play memory.  We got some more ideas, so stay tuned!All products can also be added and purchased via our add-on store, such as old and new products, LED Bases, and the Early Bird Planet Coasters. In campaigns from other creators, we have seen that shipping fees are often collected after the campaign. This has several advantages for you and us and therefore we decided to do the same. But don't worry, because of the many previous campaigns we made, we can estimate the maximum costs very well, so there are no nasty surprises waiting for you.Advantages: Meanwhile, we have a professional fulfillment partner, but in the beginning, I still packed 4000 packages by hand with my father and my brother. It all started with me, Clemens, and my wedding actually. I had just graduated as a mechanical engineer when I pitched the idea of my Universe Sphere on Kickstarter to earn some money for my wedding. The campaign was a complete success and motivated me to design more such models. From this, the company CinkS labs was born and meanwhile, we have a couple of employees who support me with my projects.Our first priority is our scientific approach. We´re conducting adequate research, we enlist the help of relevant scientists and try to figure out what will work best for our glass pieces. For the planets as an example, the difficulty is to not just laser a white ball into the glass but to make the structure visible.We design and model our 3D images to laser-etch them into the glass with the highest precision. You can hardly see the microscopic dots with the naked eye. The dots are in fact not air bubbles, as many people think, but tiny cracks that reflect light differently at varying angles due to their elongated shape. These are created by heat pulses emitted by a focused laser several thousand times per second.We made a short video of our laser process for a previous campaign, \"The Microcosm in a Sphere\".Unfortunately, we do have copycats, but with stark differences in quality.Our original Spheres offer solid optical grade glass with high resolution, scientifically accurate models and are available in 8cm as well as an unreached above average size of 15cm.  Made in - and shipped from Germany.This timeline represents something like the bad case. We know that worldwide shipments have been and will continue to be severely delayed due to various circumstances (Covid, Evergreen, Christmas etc.), thus we would rather make a conservative estimate so that you will be pleasantly surprised if we deliver sooner rather than disappointed if your spheres won't arrive in a couple of months. 2021/11/08 2021/11/01We are proud to support a former employee. He is starting his own journey soon, with the board game he worked on for four years now together with a friend: AUREA - Legacy of the Yatary.  It´s a race for the resources of an entire Galaxy. Diplomacy, Trade, Research, War...how will you play, how will you shine and how will you perish? Join his campaign and find out. We want to add a game segment to every order. Keep it to support the campaign and get a discount... or use it as a glass coaster, it´s up to you.

                "Title": "Pinsta Instant Camera - Micro Darkroom and Negative Enlarger",
                "Text": "Pinsta is a camera which can shoot directly onto positive 4x5 inch photographic paper. It develops internally, and can be used on the go, wherever you are and whenever you like for creating and sharing real analogue prints! Pinsta is also a mini-enlarger! For those already shooting film and wanting to get into analogue printing without the expense or need for a darkroom, Pinsta is here to help! Simply load your negatives into the internal enlargement slide and you can enlarge them onto 4x5 inch paper. You can even create prints with fun and creative frames and overlays using Pinsta's ingenious internal slide system.Anyone can use Pinsta to produce photographic prints of their own, at home or out and about and without any further investment in darkroom equipment besides a dark bag for loading your next shot. Nothing beats the feeling of mounting your very own real photographic prints around your home.The sense of wonder you get upon revealing your first perfectly exposed photographic print can't be matched! You will learn from the prints you get wrong, and you will treasure the prints that you get right. This is raw photography, it's really good fun, it draws a crowd and it's a little bit of magic! Find out what Mike Padua thinks of Pinsta Camera:Loading paper, taking photos and developing your Prints:Loading your Pinsta camera couldn't be easier, simply put your camera and your photographic paper into the dark/changing bag to load a new piece of paper into the camera back. To take a shot simply position your camera and open the shutter. Typical exposure on a sunny day is 2 minutes.Your prints are developed with regular photographic chemistry and it is inserted and extracted with syringes.  When you are developing the camera body is your darkroom and your camera back becomes your developing tray!Developing of black and white paper is a simple process so you can't really get it wrong. Develop for 1 minute, fix for 30 seconds to 4 minutes (depending on the paper) and add water to wash before revealing your amazing photographic print. A set of syringes will develop around 4-5 shots depending on which photographic paper you are using. The syringes are then replenished with your own chemistry once it is exhausted. Enlarging negatives:Enlarging negatives with Pinsta is very much like taking a photo except that you position the negative inside the camera in-between the pinhole and the photographic paper using Pinsta's unique negative enlargement slide.You then rotate the shutter disc to position the diffuser spot over the pinhole. Illuminating this spot with a bright light source transposes your negative onto the photographic paper inside. Your enlargement is then developed as if you had taken a photo. Using the Light Baffle/Filter slide to customize images:The internal light baffle prevents light from bouncing off the camera walls and fogging your image but it can also be used as a filter slide and for customising your photos or enlargements with overlays, textures, double exposures or shaped exposures..  There is a huge amount of creative potential with this slide. Available add-ons/accessories:£30K - Laser cut Pinsta keyring: UNLOCKED!If we reach £30,000 we will include a Pinsta laser cut keyring with each Pinsta Kit£50K - Laser cut Pinsta keyring with print removal suction cup:  UNLOCKED!If we reach £50k then the keyring add on becomes a handy print removal tool! This makes removing your developed prints much easier!£100K - 4x5 Magnetic frame included for each backer!If we reach £100k we will include a free 4x5 Magnetic Display/Drying frame with each Pinsta Kit.£200K - Pinsta community forum will be created:If we reach £200k we will create an online forum for people to share their works, ideas and techniques. We expect many people will invent new ways of using Pinsta and we think a forum would be a nice melting pot for creators to get together. We may even hold annual awards events later on.£N/A - Interchangeable pinhole system: NOW INCLUDED!at £300k we can add an interchangeable pinhole system, this will make Pinsta much more versatile going into the future. We believe we can vastly improve the enlarging quality of Pinsta if the Pinhole is modular and it will also enable us to potentially make larger backs for Pinsta such as 5x7 or 10x8 as Pinsta's current pinhole would be too small for these formats.£500K - Company dedicated focus on Pinsta: £500k would mean we can dedicate a large amount of our resources onto Pinsta and related upgrades in the future. We may even decide to focus the company on Pinsta entirely.We have lots of plans for Pinsta and our hope is that it becomes a mainstay in the photography world. We see Pinsta not only as great fun for the hobbyist and an excellent tool for artistic creators but also as a brilliant learning tool. Our hope is that Pinsta cameras will be used all over the world in education and in recreational photography workshops alike. Future accessories for Pinsta might include:We also expect that we can improve the enlarging sharpness of Pinsta in the future by offering a body extension section and a smaller pinhole.I don't know about traditional processes and I'm a bit confused!? How exactly does it work?Don't worry, Pinsta couldn't be easier to use. We will be providing full detailed instructions in nice and easy to understand videos which start at the very basics of taking photos with Pinsta. Some of the more advanced features can then be learned over time which is what makes Pinsta a wonderful learning tool.How does Pinsta achieve a positive image?Pinsta can be used with HARMAN direct positive paper which is available in 4x5 size. Using this paper means that your prints come out positive with a normal develop and fix process. Magic!What do I need to use Pinsta?In order to take photographs with Pinsta all you need is one of our kits and a film changing bag which are available as an add on. For paper and chemistry we recommend and have tested HARMAN 4x5 direct positive paper, ILFORD multigrade developer and ILFORD rapid fixer. If you wish to enlarge negatives with Pinsta you will also need the negative enlargement slide (available as an add on) and we recommend and have tested ILFORD 4x5 multigrade RC delux (negative) paper. In addition you will need a nice bright light source, almost any light source will do but we recommend something like an ultra bright LED torch that can be positioned closely to the diffuser spot as this will reduce exposure times. Ideally it should be plugged-in to the mains since this gives more consistent results than relying on battery power. Most rechargeable units can remain plugged in whilst in use. Paper and chemistry are available as a kit at a discounted price for Pinsta backers at www.firstcallphotographic.com. We will provide backers with a discount code once the campaign has ended. Can I use different processes in Pinsta?You can. Pinsta can be used however you want. If you have a different chemical process or medium you would like to use then Pinsta should be compatible with most things. Extra syringes are available if you have additional processes such as chemical reversal etc. We are very excited to see how people use Pinsta in different creative ways!How does Pinsta extract chemistry through that hole?The chemistry hole in the side of Pinsta leads to a tube which goes down to the tray. The chemistry is delivered and picked up right next to your photographic paper, it doesn't squirt in opposite the hole on the outer body..Do I have to keep buying chemistry syringes?No you refill the syringes that come with the kit. This also saves on plastic waste associated with instant camera cartridge systems. They should last indefinitely and will be provided with coloured stickers so that you can identify which syringe is for which chemistry. Is there much cleaning in-between each use?There is a little wiping required but not much. ABS is quite water repellent and most of the liquids are extracted by syringe. We recommend taking out a towel with you. A quick wipe of the bottom 20mm's of the camera body and the tray and it's ready to go again. Agitation is a gentle process and chemistry doesn't splash around inside if you are doing it correctly.Can I shoot film in Pinsta?You can shoot 4x5 film no problems! It is possible for more advanced users to shoot 35mm or 120 film by cutting it and putting it into the internal enlargement slide. This would probably require a darkroom though as it would prove fiddly in a dark bag. We do plan to release film backs for Pinsta at a later date along with many other accessories and add-ons.What are typical Exposure times of Pinsta?Pinsta is rated at F266 and Ilford direct positive paper is ISO 1-3. Typical exposure times are: Very sunny 1-2 minutes, Sunny 2-4 minutes, Sunny with clouds 4-12 minutes, Cloudy 12-30 minutes, Dull daylight conditions 40min-4hours. Indoor conditions can vary massively depending on lighting etc.Enlargement exposure times vary depending on your light source and the particular type of negatives you are using between 1 minute and 60 minutes. Black and white negative enlarge much faster than colour negatives.Is Pinsta expensive to use?The cost of the chemistry will come in at pennies per shot. Ilford direct positive paper rrp is £1 or $1.39 per sheet. Ilford Multigrade (negative) paper rrp is £0.53p or $0.73 per sheet. Polariod 600's rrp by comparison is £2.50 or $3.47 per shot and provides much smaller photos. (costs based on UK prices and may vary depending on your location/availability).Paper and chemistry are available as a kit at a discounted price for Pinsta backers at www.firstcallphotographic.com. We will provide backers with a discount code once the campaign has ended. Are my negatives safe inside Pinsta?The internal negative slide has been designed to protect your negatives from any splashing that may occur during the developing process. If you would prefer you can actually remove the negative slide from the camera using the dark bag after exposure and before developing. This means your negatives are not at any risk at all.How good is the enlarging quality?The enlarging quality from 120 negatives is surprisingly good considering that it is a lenseless system and certainly good enough for putting 4x5 pictures around your home, the larger the negatives the sharper the image for various reasons. The 35mm enlargements are a little softer and we recommend they are most useful for portraits and images that have less small details in them. Please see the examples section below for examples of each type of image.Pinhole:Pinholes have infinite focal length, so everything is in focus which is what makes many of the features of Pinsta possible. Pinsta camera includes a pinhole carefully selected at the right diameter (0.3mm's) and is manufactured using a special process called double etching, which ensures the absolute highest quality images possible are produced.The quality of the pinhole is crucial to image quality. Professional quality double chemically etched pinholes aren't cheap and many other pinhole camera kits come with drilled or laser cut pinholes to save money.. Not Pinsta.Shutter:Pinsta's shutter is different to any other camera on the market. It includes 3 photo settings for full frame and round and oval vignetted crop shots.This rotates on a clicker which locks each setting into place. The lever allows you to switch to another setting quickly and easily.The shutter disc also houses the white diffuser spot which is used for enlarging negatives. The diffuser spot is positioned over the pinhole and is illuminated using any external light source. This light passes through the negative and projects the negative  onto your photographic paper.Body:The Pinsta body is made from thick 'pinseal' ABS and has a nice weight and high quality feel to it with landscape and portrait bubble levels. It has a number of cool features, the most significant of which is the ability to add and extract chemistry through a special light tight cavity using syringes. This means when developing your images your camera body is actually also your darkroom. The body also includes 2 tripod mounts for portrait and landscape shots, 2 bubble levels and gun sights to ensure you're getting the correct framing.Camera Back/Tray:The back of your camera is also your developing tray. It includes magnets which fix it to the camera body and ensure perfect light tightness. This accommodates 4x5 inch photo paper or film. The photographic paper is sandwiched between the camera back and the camera body which holds it flat and in place when shooting and developing. The paper also acts as a gasket which prevents the chemistry from leaking.Enlargement Slide: (available as an add-on)The enlargement slide can accommodate 35mm, 645, 6x6 and 6x7 negatives (6x7 size will be cropped to 6x6). There are different mounting positions inside the camera body depending on which negative size you are using.The possibilities are quite literally endless with the internal slide system and we're really excited to see what our backers do with this innovation. Advanced users can even shoot film using these slides, or double expose a new shot with an existing negative..Internal Light Baffle/Filter Slide: (included in all kits)The internal light baffle/filter slide is similar to the enlargement slide but it is used to prevent unwanted light from bouncing around inside the camera and fogging your prints. This is one of the reasons that Pinsta gives excellent image quality.This slide can also be used for attaching filters or for customising your images with custom shaped exposures when you are shooting or enlarging. It is designed to be left in the camera at all times when shooting in the slide position closest to the pinhole. Dark Bag: (available as an add-on)The dark bag is a light tight bag used to load your next shot into the camera. It keeps your paper or film from being exposed to light during its journey between the paper box and the camera. Our dark bags are bigger than some others on the market which makes loading your Pinsta camera a little easier. Drying/Display Frames: (available as an add-on)Our magnetized drying frames are used for keeping your print relatively flat whilst it dries. Fiber based papers can bend quite a lot whilst drying so if you intend to shoot mostly fiber based papers such as Harman direct positive paper then we suggest adding on a few drying frames. These ensure that your prints dry evenly and remain flat whilst they dry.These frames can also be used to display your photographs around the house and are great for displaying your work as fridge magnets!Contact Plate/Print Press: (available as an add-on)More advanced users may like our magnetized contact plate add on. The contact plate means that you can produce 'false' positive images using negative paper. This plate produces a perfect positive replica of your negative by sandwiching it with a fresh piece of negative paper and then exposing it to light. You can then transfer the exposed false positive to your Pinsta inside a dark bag for developing as normal.It can also be used as a print press! Leave them in here for a day or two and they'll be perfectly flat.Syringe:Each kit comes with 3 or more syringes, these syringes are used for inserting and extracting your chemistry. They come with coloured stickers for identifying which syringe is for which chemistry. Additional syringes are available as an add-on.Syringe Dock: (available as an add-on)The syringe dock is used to store your syringes. This keeps them safe and secure during transit and also makes them easier to organize when developing prints. The syringe dock also has a handy strap mount so they can be mounted onto the strap of your camera bagBottle Kit: (available as an add-on)The bottle kit includes 3 chemistry bottles and one larger dump bottle.  The bottles have sealed lids. These come in very useful especially if you plan on taking lots of photos whilst you're out or are going on a longer excursion. The larger tops allow easy access for your syringes.You must always dispose of your exhausted chemistry in a responsible manner so even if you don't add our bottle kit you will need to carry storage for your spent chemistry.Here are some examples of photos and enlargements made with Pinsta Camera. Find more images and video examples on our instagram page:My name is Oliver, I am 35 years old and have been a keen photographer and inventor my life so far, taking after my Dad Harry New who invented the Nova Vertical slot print processor back in the 1980's.Sitting on a stool next to my dad in his darkroom is one of my most distinct memories as a small child. The combination of sounds, smells and the wonder of watching images illuminated by the red glow of the safelight magically appear in front of my eyes is something I will never forget. He would often shoot weddings and show jumping events and would occasionally let me sit in on his darkroom sessions.My first proper camera was a Pentax ME and I had a fascination with long exposures and used to go into the garden at night experimenting, setting my camera up with a fixed open shutter and shining my torch on the plants and trees. I'd take the film up to the local photography shop to have it developed for collection the next day. The anticipation all part of the enjoyment of the process. Something lost with the instant gratification lifestyles we all live in now..Years on and in a small factory in rural Warwickshire our family company had been hand making pinhole cameras for one of the biggest names in the industry when one day it occurred to me that there was an opportunity for us to produce something more accessible to people without a darkroom. Something that could hopefully introduce new people into the magic of traditional photography, and to help advanced photographers learn even more about the origins their trade. From this idea Pinsta was born...The development of Pinsta:Product prototyping is one of the things our company does, which is fortunate as it has saved us a lot of costs which we can actually pass on to you! Overall we've spent around a year developing Pinsta to the complete product it is now. We have produced around 15 different designs of various types. Continual improvements have been made to the designs of the shutter disc, chemistry/ventilation system, sights, pinhole, tray/back and internal slide system.Pinsta at the Photography Show:We thoroughly enjoyed exhibiting at the photography show and received nothing but amazing comments and feedback on Pinsta. We felt it was important to show that Pinsta was a serious and fully developed product and what better way to do this than demonstrate it to thousands of people at the show. I did many demonstrations and interviews for various magazines and publications. Thankyou to everyone who showed up and gave their support, some people even came just to see Pinsta!Amateur Photographer Magazine recorded this live negative enlargement demonstration for their social media platforms (poor sound): Sunny 16 Podcast also popped over and made a video and we should be featuring on their podcast soon: Jon Bentley from the Gadget show even paid a visit:There is no doubt that photography in all its forms can have a huge impact on mental health. The combination of elements that involve the process make it an inherently therapeutic pass time. Getting out somewhere you might not otherwise go, meeting people, engaging in an art form, joining a community, the enjoyment of taking beautiful images and the continual pursuit of learning (because there is always more to learn) are just some of the reasons why photography brings so many people so much happiness.We believe that analogue photography in particular encourages a state of mindfulness and the slower processes are in themselves a meditation. In a world where everything is fast and on demand it's a wonderful liberation to rediscover the joy of taking your time and enjoying a real tactile and thought provoking process.A big thankyou:Lastly I'd like to give a big thankyou to Mark Anthony Galluzzo and his company Mabinogi who not only produced our campaign video for us but did a great deal of testing with Pinsta. We couldn't have been more happy with them and the genuinely personal service that they provided.https://www.mabinogi.co.uk/crowdfunding/ If you would like further updates on new Pinsta products/accessories after the campaign then please join our mailing list at www.pinstacamera.com",

                "Creator": "Amonito",
                "Title": "Amonito - The Lightest All-In-One Guitar Amplifier",
                "Text": "Ever tried to carry a big heavy combo amp to a gig, and then transport it back home at 1 am, all in an effort to impress the audience with a great sound?Did you buy countless expensive pedals, because you cannot play a gig with the amp giving you just one sound?Ever tried to achieve a perfect sound with a modeling amp, but can never shake the feeling that it could be better if you maybe just spent a few more days tweaking the sound?We tried all of that.All of the hardship of those problems manifested into creating a truly unique solution, a guitar amp that is light and versatile, and sounds incredible with every setting you have it set to.You no longer need to make a choice between the quality, warmth, and ease of use of a tube amplifier and the versatility and lightness of modern guitar systems.Amonito is a guitar amplification system that brings together boutique guitar effects, an incredible sounding tube analog circuit, instant switching between presets, and a quality loud sound monitoring system all in one extremely light package.Three main segments are responsible for Amonito sounding as good as it does.Each of these is a novelty on the guitar amp market, but together they make for one of the most incredible pieces of guitar gear that the world has ever seen.At the heart of Amonito is the main analog compact circuit, that responds and sounds like a full tube amp. A combination of two vacuum tubes, 12AX7 and 12AU7, and MOSFETS are all running on high voltage to give the guitarist ultimate dynamic range and feel that no digital processing could accomplish. Dozens of strategically placed little electronic switches make this one of the most versatile tube circuits on the market today.And because almost every player needs effects like reverb, chorus, delay, and others, we added a special chip - one of the most powerful SHARC® DSPs that is responsible for all of the effects that complete the sound coming out of the analog circuit.We could have stopped there, but there was one thing bothering us.What many guitarists that have played tube amps know is that they don’t sound amazing on just any setting - they have a sweet spot. A certain setting that sounds the best, but this makes the amp less versatile and you can’t always have it as loud as necessary to get to it.And since we have that SHARC® power, we put the DSP before and after the analog circuit!This is how we achieved total control of the sound and made one sweet spot a thing of the past! The amp has now become interconnected with thousands of parameters, many of them helping to prepare the sound for its journey in the high voltage analog world, and the rest applying finishing touches after it transitions back into the digital. No other analog amp has ever had such flexibility!Playing and creating music is a deeply intimate process and with our product, we want the guitarists to spend their time in the creative zone and to enjoy the experience instead of tweaking every single parameter while reading the manual.To address this, instead of offering an off-the-shelf LCD and a thick manual on how to use it, we designed custom touchscreen displays like you haven’t seen before. There are no pixels, it feels and looks analog.Each knob on these displays is smartly connected to many parameters and intertwined with other knobs so that you get a beautifully simple experience while the system in the background does all the hard work to keep the sound great no matter what you do.Combined with extremely reliable optical footswitches, to which the user can assign their own personal settings, you are now in instant control of not just the effects, but also the whole analog tube amp structure, with just a push of a single button.Amonito features a wireless access point, so when we upgrade the software, you would just have to use the app to upload the latest release. No need for a cable, all of the software updates will be available wirelessly through the app, so uploading the latest released firmware on Amonito will be made as simple as possible.To make it as light and sturdy as possible, we moved away from wood for the construction material and chose - aluminum for the more affordable Classic version and carbon fiber for the premium, Carbon version.With a ported design to give you a deep, full sound, and a power amplifier that delivers 200W RMS this cabinet is truly something different. The sound of a high-quality 8” neodymium speaker is being further enhanced by our processing and is firing into a specially constructed wave deflector to give you a smooth top end and wide coverage with high frequencies. It doesn’t sound like a guitar speaker, but like a guitar speaker that has been professionally miked up in the studio, and with different amps you also hear different speakers! You haven’t heard an 8” speaker that sounds like this.But we went one step further! We completely changed the way you hear this speaker system on stage and moved it from the usual position in the back to the front where the guitarist can hear it much better. This way the sound spill from the stage is greatly reduced - sound guys will absolutely love it! And with dedicated XLR outputs for the PA, it means that the audience will get to enjoy great sound too.We paired Amonito with some of the most popular electric guitars, played by guitarists with their unique style. While many modern amplifiers sound similar with different guitars and players, Amonito really lets the character of the guitar and guitarist's technique shine through.Andy is a London-based guitar player influenced by Eric Clapton, Albert Collins, and other guitar legends. Andy has toured with James Bay for many years and has also played with one of the blues greats, Buddy Guy. He was a founding member of the band Cortes and is now also creating his original work under his name, Andy Cortes.Oz has played with members of Judas Priest, Alice Cooper, Cradle of Filth, and has Manowar guitarist David Snake, as well as many others, guesting on the new CD of his band Snake Eyes.\n   He also has a YouTube channel \"Guitar Safari\" where he does gear reviews.Both of our products feature the same analog tube circuit, the same amplifier and speaker, and the same user interface. But, there are differences between them that make the Carbon version a more premium model.Both versions of Amonito offer the same functionality, which is comprised of 5 main stages:The PRE section includes guitar effects that are used in front of an amplifier by most guitarists. Just like normal pedals, these effects have a lot of control, but most of it is hidden away in our smart processing. Only one of these effects can be on at the same time.There are four types of amplifiers to choose from, two base models and two variants of them. Each one has a different sound and feel, thanks to the extensive physical switching of the analog circuit.Everyone is probably familiar with EQ settings, but while simple to use, on Amonito, these are much more powerful than it seems at first glance.With the help of smart processing, the whole amplifier is reacting to these settings so that is not simply an EQ after the amplifier section, but it is modifying the signal so that you “get what you wish for”.For example, if you would like to have the sound from a bright clean vintage amplifier (assuming a vintage clean model is selected on the AMP section), simply increase the treble and possibly reduce the bass and the whole amp will shift around these parameters to provide you with a sound that would be produced by a typical bright vintage tube amp. Even effects before the amplifier will adjust to these settings.(Almost) no guitar sound is perfect without some kind of reverb, delay, or other modulation effects - or even all together.The last thing every amplifier needs is a way to turn it on and off and to be able to mute all of the outputs with just one button. Both of these have been incorporated into our displays.Amonito offers all the main connections you need in a live or a studio environment. First, the signal is received by a high impedance FET input that preserves its original clarity and definition and is sent to the rest of the circuitry via a low noise balanced connection.Since many guitarists will never part with their own choice of pedals and effects, Amonito offers a send/return loop that is positioned after the analog tube circuit and can be switched on or off via a button on the displays. This allows the user to turn the send/return loop on or off using the footswitches on Amonito.Since the built-in speaker is intended to be used as a personal stage guitar monitoring system, Amonito features two other main outputs to be used either in the studio or in a live performance. Line outputs are carrying a raw signal, that can either be processed by software plugins in a studio environment or plugged into another power amp on stage. The XLR outputs carry a signal that has been optimized for live, PA applications. A high-quality IR cabinet simulation makes sure that even the most nit-picking live sound technicians will be satisfied with the sound. And of course, these outputs can be used in a studio recording for a very quick and effortless setup.Amonito Carbon comes with stereo Send/return, line, and XLR output connections, while ALL the connections on Amonito Classic are mono. We believe that a high-quality product such as Amonito should never be carried around without protection. Therefore, we will be shipping every product with a corresponding padded bag.Currently, we only have one prototype for the bag ready, and it will take some trial and error to get it just the way we want it. But, we can tell you that the final bag will be light, padded on all sides, and equipped with a carrying handle and backpack straps! This way, you will be able to easily take Amonito everywhere you go and will not have to worry about damaging the surface or hardware.For even more reliable transportation, we will be offering a hard case made from fiberglass. It will be available for purchase as an add-on, but later on, once the project has been successfully funded.We are Marko and Andraž and we come from Slovenia, Europe. Both electrical engineers and both musicians. Our journey of building guitar amplifiers began about 6 years ago when we decided to build our first unique tube amp. Since then we have designed and built many guitar amplifiers, bass and guitar effects, and other audio products. During this time we were actively involved in our bands, playing all sorts of big and small venues, meeting all sorts of musicians, especially guitarists, and getting to know their musical styles, habits, problems, and wishes. We discovered that a lot of them were unhappy with their gear, may it be the weight, sound, limitations, and even complexity of the modern guitar equipment.That's where the idea of creating our innovative guitar amplifier came in.We discovered that with our knowledge of electrical engineering, programming, and amp building we could make a difference by providing guitarists with an amplifier that sounds just as good as the old tube amps, but is extremely lighter, includes all the must-have modern effects, offers the choice of completely restructuring the analog tube circuit with a flick of a preset switch, but still remains as easy and intuitive to use as the old amps were. No more back hurting at 3 AM after a concert. No more confusing connections between pieces of gear. No more spending weeks or even months in your studio, trying to find that perfect sound. Just lighter, smarter, and intuitive. The vision for the AMONITO guitar amplifier was born.After more than a year of prototyping and validating the concept of innovative weight reduction techniques we pitched this idea to the start-up incentive program P2 at the Slovene enterprise fund and got the grant. This enabled us to assemble a small team and continue working on the project. Since then it has almost been two years, and during this time the whole team worked very hard to make this project a reality.We can't tell you how excited we are to finally be able to offer Amonito to guitarists all over the world!Marko and Andraž, founders and lead developers of the AMONITO guitar amplifier",

It is a breakthrough in portable microscopy - we're pretty proud, and thank you all for your support.We keep improving and polishing the iMicros, and we never stop - now we've taken our effort one step further and are pleased to bring you the new fingertip microscope - iMicro Q2p, the first smartphone microscope with polarizing function.Since Antony van Leeuwenhoek invented his microscope in the 17th century, microscope technology has progressed tremendously. Microscopes with excellent performance are usually bulky, heavy, and expensive, even for portable ones. With our years of effort, what we introduced in 2018 - the fingertip microscope iMicro Q - is a real breakthrough in mobile microscopy. It has comparable optical performance to a professional desktop microscope and enables you to carry it with you as easily as you bring your phone. In addition to the iMicro Q's excellent optical performance and portability, we launched iMicro Q2 in 2020 with enhanced compatibility to work with any smartphone.Polarized light is a contrast-enhancing technique that improves the quality of the image obtained with birefringent materials, such as crystals, minerals, liquid crystals, and plastics. The polarized light microscope (polarizing microscope) is designed to observe and photograph specimens primarily due to its optically anisotropic character. Usually, a polarized light microscope is much more expensive and only available for professionals. Now with iMicro Q2p, in addition to the function of a typical biology microscope, we bring you this tiny Fingertip Microscope with the fantastic polarizing function.Here are some micrographs took with iMicro Q2p (using an iPhone 11):Here are more example micrographs with polarizers and without polarizers - solid proof that the polarizing function dramatically enhanced the contrast with rich colors.To our knowledge, iMicro Q2p is the first smartphone microscope with the polarizing function integrated with such a small profile.  Our previous backers queried a lot on a focusing stand/support to the fingertip microscopes. We listen to our backers, and we have worked hard on designing a convenient, flexible, intuitive stand to allow precision focusing. Finally, we have a satisfactory solution.  It works very well and is also simple to use. It has the same high magnification as iMicro Q and Q2. Here are the micrographs of the fiber from one dental floss. If you don't have a microscope, you don't know it has such a fine structure on this fiber. It is amazing!Resolution is more important than magnification when speaking about the performance of a microscope. The USAF 1951 resolution test chart was used to test the resolution of iMicro Q2p on an iPhone 11. The intervals between the finest test bars are 2.19 micrometers. The finest test bars on the 7th group are clearly seen, indicating its resolution is far beyond that.We used a grid calibration target to test the distortion. Even in full view at the edge of the visual field, no noticeable distortion was observed.It is about the size of a fingertip and weighs only 0.5g (~1/60 oz). It is very thin, only 3.2mm (1/8 inch). No parts extrude beyond the edge of your phone when it is installed. Also, the focusing stand has not increased the profile regarding the whole pack - still in the card size and easily fit in a wallet.We are very proud of the Fingertip Microscope and would like everyone to be able to afford it. With a polarizing function, we can still keep it at a low cost. With the money you would need to buy a traditional desktop microscope, you could purchase many Fingertip Microscopes, making this a great option for children and students.As iMicro Q2 lens and iMicro C lens, we design iMicro Q2p in a tiny round style to fit any phone with a camera. They will be coupled to your smartphone by an innovative, re-useable, nano-suction pad. Whether your phone has a single back camera or multiple back cameras, a flat camera(s), or extruded camera(s), these tiny round lenses will fit well with them. The magnification mainly relies on its complex optical system for traditional compound microscopes, including objective and eyepiece. Its total magnification is a combination of the magnification of objective and eyepiece.For our fingertip microscope, three stages of magnification are combined to achieve the total magnification. First, the lens provides optical magnification to generate the image on the smartphone camera's sensor; second, the image on the sensor is displayed on the much larger screen via the electronic process and magnification; third, digital zoom provides further magnification as a digital magnification to the image. The total magnification is a combination of these three.The traditional polarizing microscope has a complex structure. Especially a polarizer and another polarizer (analyzer) are added before and after the specimen in the optical system. For iMicro Q2p, we mimic this polarizing structure but keep it in a small profile.We have walked a long way to develop these smartphone-based microscopic tools since registering the first patent in 2012. We have already successfully built a series of smartphone microscope products, including iMICROSCOPE, iMICROSCOPE R, and the μRuler, iMicro Q, iMicro C, iMicro Q2, as well as this new version iMicro Q2p.We have shaped and polished our Fingertip Microscope idea according to previous backers' and customers' suggestions and comments based on our previous successful projects. We have optimized the optics and the overall design, and each step was tested and refined using prototypes to achieve the best performance possible.The lens is a crucial component of the system. A small ball lens (van Leeuwenhoek) is a straightforward approach. But it is well known to suffer from a very limited usable field of view due to severe field curvature effects, spherical and other aberrations. The iMicro Q2p uses a more complex multi-aspherical lens design and integrated polarizer to achieve high magnification performance and low aberration with polarizing function.In iMicro Q2p, we incorporated a new reflection/polarizing/transmission lighting. The thin PP case is not only used to pack and protect the product but also used as a light-reflective illumination box. The light from the flashlight and ambient light goes to the bottom of the lighting box and is reflected from the thin PP case's bottom wall to illuminate the sample after being polarized. Unlike conventional adhesive, the nano suction pad mimics gecko's footpads: it has thousands of micro air pockets functioning like micro-suction cups to hold the device to the phone.Every on and off application will leave nothing on the phone. This newly developed \"nano suction pad\" is residue-free, non-tacky, and repeatable. The use of a nano suction pad has been proved in our previous product, and it is repeatable and easily cleaned by a PSA tape (such as Scotch tape).We believe you will like this focusing stand - it works very well and keeps a low profile. It is made of engineering plastic (PMMA, acrylic resin) and is strong enough with durability. It is also very simple and easy to set up to use. After using it, you can disassembly it and store it in the thin PP case.A high-quality μRuler M (stage micrometer) will be provided with iMicro Q2p to calibrate the scale-bar in our App, i-Seeing, and enable you to measure size accurately. Please see our previous campaign, μRuler- A micro-ruler to measure micro-objects, for more information. μRuler Q will be available as an add-on.iMicro Q2p actually works with any camera App which can control the flashlight when shooting or you provide illumination with an extra torch. In some cases, it is crucial to have a scale-bar and ensure its accuracy on the micrograph. The dedicated App, i-Seeing, was designed to take micrographs to meet professional demand. The scale-bar on the micrograph can be toggled on/off to enable you to embed a scale-bar on the image if required.It is super portable, and you don't need complicated settings, so you can immediately take images, use them for reporting and transferring images to your colleagues. Plus, you can use it with any smartphone. It can be used in many professions where you need accurate images and easily accessible research photographs in the field. Many of our previous backers shared their application with beautiful and unique pictures when using the fingertip microscopes. Here are a few examples. Many of them are from our previous backers' photos with the iMicro Q2 and iMicro C on their phones; Some of them are our test photos for the polarizing function. With the polarizing function, you will have more power for its application.This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 2,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $900M raised between them.",

You can see some of the ideas we’ve tried so far. We'll also include cool decals so that you can trick out your ride and make it your own. Get ready for some ghost flames, racing stripes, and maybe an F = ma bumper sticker!?The journey to making PocketLab G-Force started in 2016 with our Need for Speed (Measurements)! Speed is a science concept that almost everyone understands, but it is actually really difficult to measure. We’ve been building roller coasters out of HotWheels™ track, K’Nex™, and anything else we can think of and using our sensors to turn them into science experiments. But it never quite worked well enough, so that’s why we built G-Force. Here’s an epic classroom roller coasters from some intrepid PocketLab physics teachers.For the last year, we’ve been designing the hardware and mechanical systems that make up PocketLab G-Force. We have gone through many prototypes and we’re finally ready for production. The funding we raise on Kickstarter will go to the production costs of the product plus the up front costs for the machining and tooling needed for injection molding and circuit board assembly.Here’s a raw, uncut video of the PocketLab G-Force prototype connecting to our Notebook app and streaming data in real-time. The PocketLab Team is a small group of engineers and teachers that believe in the joy of science.

Tony describes himself as a \"reformed\" lawyer who has spent the last decade of his professional life leading healthcare, wellness, and technology companies. Alissa has spent her entire career in digital media and television production. She also has two Emmys for her work sitting on the couple's mantle (Tony has no Emmys, but Alissa let him hold them once). Together, while working our separate day jobs and raising our three young children, we run BLOK from our home in the suburbs just outside of Philadelphia.We spent a lot of time this past year cooking together at home. We quickly realized there were no fun and contemporary cooking classes that we could realistically stream with our family members in different locations throughout the country.That’s when the idea for BLOK was born! We put pen to paper and started working on developing BLOK. We came up with an attractive custom-designed piece of hardware that creates a virtual experience for friends and family where they can learn to prepare delicious and healthy meals in a fun and engaging way. BLOK is so much more than a smart cutting board, it’s a community of foodies all over the world!As the most trusted product launch company in the world, Enventys Partners has helped launch over 2,000 innovations with global sales of over $1 Billion dollars for our clients.By utilizing 20 years of experience in:Got an idea? We would love to help you launch it.BLOK’s founding principle is to cultivate a community in the kitchen-- to provide consumers access to real, relatable chefs while cooking delicious meals with friends and family. Without that community, and passionate, inspiring chefs, BLOK wouldn’t exist— and that’s why BLOK is committed to giving back. If BLOK reaches its Kickstarter funding goal, co-founders Tony and Alissa will make a personal donation of $2,000 to Careers through Culinary Arts Program. C-CAP is a workforce development nonprofit that provides underserved teens a pathway to success in the culinary arts in Philadelphia and across the country.

                "Text": "How clean is your home really? Does it smell or feel stuffy sometimes? You've probably experienced bad odours at some point in your house. PURRAIR has been created to solve those problems most effectively and efficiently. Discover the life-changing magic of PURRAIR!Why choose PURRAIR over other products in the market? Unlike the other existing air purifiers, PURRAIR is permanent, convenient, simple, and most importantly, different. Regardless of the environment or situation, PURRAIR will get the job done and outperform competitors.Periodic Spraying - the spray type air fresheners we are so familiar with, for example, Febreeze, do not have a long-lasting effect.  The effects dissipate a few minutes after spraying and bad odors return. PURRAIR is different from those temporary relief sprays. PURRAIR will refresh the air by eliminating harmful substances floating in the air. One of the most impressive features of PURRAIR is that it barely makes any noise. While it has an impeccable performance, the fan embedded in the device allows for a soundless performance. Individuals or pets sensitive to noise will feel at ease while PURRAIR is doing its job.PURRAIR does not require any replacement. Therefore there's no additional or hidden cost.  PURRAIR's plasma unit is permanent, so you won't need any replacement filters. Improve your air quality and let your savings grow.PURRAIR's compact size and flat design make it portable. You can drop it into your backpack and take it anywhere with you. Bring the heavy performance with you while keeping your backpack light. Make your work desk an air-safe zone or board a flight without any worries about cross-contamination.  Conventional air purifiers cannot reach hidden corners such as shoe cupboards and pantries. PURRAIR's magnetic installation and high-capacity internal battery make it ideal for taking control of these difficult to reach spaces. Let PURRAIR work behind doors and improve the air quality everywhere. PURRAIR's simple and minimal aesthetics are designed to fit all interior spaces, from mid-century to victorian style. We have prepared six beautiful colors so that you can choose the right fit for your home and office. The hidden LED indicator shows the battery status. You can use it with the USB adapter connected or disconnected. The internal high-capacity battery will provide up to 20 hours of disconnected use. It only takes two and a half hours to charge fully.Simply touch and enjoy clean air. If odors are severe then touch one more time for the boost mode. The fan will increase its speed up to 8,500 rpm and complete the difficult task of severe odor removal.No need to replace anything and no need to wash anything. You just need to swab the plasma pins every three weeks, which only takes 30 seconds. A cotton swab and 30 seconds every three weeks are all you need for maintenance. Chemical residue can be harmful to self-grooming pets and curious children. Unlike spray-type odor removers, PURRAIR leaves no residue while cleansing the air. The Ozone occurrence rate is only 0.008 ppm, significantly lower than the FDA's requirement of \"No more than 0.05\".Due to COVID-19, problems such as shipping and logistics around the world continue to grow. Due to the shipping crisis, customers' parcels are often lost or delayed, and some of them are not being tracked. Purrit has negotiated with several carriers to resolve this issue. Finally, we have decided to ship all packages via air transport. To all customers who purchase PURRAIR on Kickstarter, we ship the product by air courier to all regions of the world. This shipping method is one of the fastest. It takes 2-5 days for these flights to arrive at the customer's destination. It also provides accurate tracking information until the customer receives the product. Customers will be able to receive the product within a week after the production of the PURRAIR production is completed.  All staff will do their best to not only deliver but also advance the announced production schedule.  PURRIT is made up of engineers with extensive experience in development, design, software, production, and delivery. ",

                "Text": "A bike safety device that projects a safe zone around your bike, responds to road users around you, identifying safe and unsafe roads in your city. We believe cycling is the best way to travel around a city. It can also be really dangerous and stressful. Close passes by overtaking cars are the biggest cause of fatal or serious accidents involving cyclists. Road rage is on the rise as communication between cyclists and motorists is limited, and we have little understanding of the safest route to cycle across our city. tether was invented to solve this problem and connect to a new community that create safer roads for everyone the more they use it.tether has been designed to attach to any handlebars, top stem or down stem giving a clear line of sight for the sensors and allowing the projection to display around the bike. Current functionality and experience:The final refinements will include: Our pre production prototype is fully functional and being road tested to iron out the final kinks, we have established relationships with component suppliers, with PCBs and casings being manufacured right here in London. Our assembly is also done in our workshop in Bethnal Green. We have spent a year developing prototypes, testing out different technologies, approaches and incorporating feedback from our early adopters. Narrowing down to a prototype that is easy to attach and universal to all handlebars. tether is designed, assembled and manufactured in the U.K. between our design studio in Peckham and our manufacturing shop in Shoreditch, good for product quality, ethically manufactured and good for our carbon footprint too.tether is designed to connect you to a community to create safe cycling routes for one another. The more people have and use tether the more we learn about which areas of your city are safe or unsafe to ride through.The sensors are the clever part, they are similar to the parking sensors in cars, they detect passing vehicles on either side and in front. Readings are taken and the distances of overtakes recorded (up to 2.5m) and sent in real time to the app.  We've even figured out a way to distinguish between people, cars, lamposts buses and even dogs... The app records the GPS location of where overtakes are happening, based on how safe (or unsafe) those overtakes are we can analyse and display routes for you to travel on safer and stress free. We found that there are lots of different types of handlebars out there, by working with our early adopters and attaching and testing it to multiple bikes we are confident tether can attach to any bike and any handlebar.Our pre production prototype is being road tested with everyday cyclists, couriers, and commuters with folding bikes. \"WOW, there you go (when turning it on for the first time\" C.O. Commuter, rides an old school road bike“I spend so much money on bike tech, and this would actually make me safer and help me be on the front foot with letting drivers know, this is my space. All the drivers in London hate couriers like me.” Jeremy, courier, rides an ebike\"I think the projection of cyclist safe space is great but the idea of the community creating safe cycling routes for one another is something I've not seen before.\" J.K commuter and weekend warrior We are currently in testing with our early adopters and aiming to fund the 1st production run of 200 with the funds raised on Kickstarter. We have chosen to limit the first run to 200 to keep quality high, ensure manufacturing and assembly can stay in the UK and most importantly to ensure that the team can be dedicated to service and support our early backers, before moving onto the next stages of our roadmap.We hope this first stage will prove the demand for a product like this and provide us with enough data to identify problematic or dangerous areas of the cities where our users are riding. In the long run we are interested in developing tether for other forms of micromobility from skateboards to scooters, and that the patterns we uncover can be used by courier fleets or planning better cycling infrastructure for cities.www.tether.bikeIn March of 2020 - ether emerged as a skunkworks project from goya design studio with a small team of engineers and designers from Loughborough University (where Omar graduated from). Starting as an idea to help people socially distance during their outdoor exercise during lockdown we quickly uncovered the dangers cyclists face by closely overtaking cars. Omar the founder of goya was himself knocked off his bike in a similar way 20 years earlier, suffering a bad head injury.Working remotely the team developed the initial prototypes, testing behind closed doors until we successfully applied for a patent protection which is currently pending.",

                "Text": "We have made smart buttons for over seven years. A common problem we see with smart home setups is that family members often don't understand how to control it.  Flic Twist is our dream of a perfect smart home controller. It bridges the gap between advanced users and tech-averse family members.Push and Rotate are easy to use and understand. Unlock advanced modes by pushing and rotating at the same time. Flic Twist introduces four functions never before seen in Smart Home: Smart Dimming, Advanced Dimming, Scene Blender and Selector. The Flic Hub Mini is a tiny yet powerful computer that takes your Flic Twist input and creates magic with your smart home devices. The optimized long range communication works on distances of up to 50m (150ft), makes the battery of Twist last for over 2 years, and has a ultrafast latency of less than 0.1 second. A blink of an eye takes 0.1 to 0.4 seconds.We are part of the unifying smart home standard Matter that will bring all ecosystems and devices together when it rolls out in 2022. With Matter allowing products to work seamlessly with each other, you can focus on building a smarter home and Flic Twist will allow your family to enjoy it. Matter is however not a requirement for using Flic Twist with your favorite brands.Our last three products Flic 1, Flic Hub, and Flic 2, were created thanks to you and people like you. We invented the Smart Button and now we’re back again with a new innovation for smart home control!Smart Dimming just works. You can apply it to any existing setup in two simple steps: select the parameter (like brightness, volume, or window blind position) and the devices you want to control. Smart Dimming adjusts each parameter individually, maintaining the relative differences between devices. Even if you go all the way up or down, you will always be able to get back to where you were.It also plays along nicely with other means of control, like voice commands or other apps. If something changes, Smart Dimming will observe and adapt to be ready for making smooth adjustments the next time you use it.Advanced Dimming works the same way as Smart Dimming but with much more options. When rotating you can adjust brightness, color, or saturation simultaneously. Sequence the lights and even add events.Advanced Dimming Example 1: Adjust brightness and color temperature simultaneouslyAdvanced Dimming Example 2: SequencingAdvanced Dimming Example 3: Combine Sequencing with brightness and color temperature Flic Twist's innovative Scene Blender mode allows you to preset up to 4 different light scenes. It fades smoothly between your scenes so you can select just the level in between that fits your mood for the moment. Scene Blender Example 1: Blend Scenes and Adjust BrightnessUse Smart Dimming on Rotate and Scene Blender on Push-Rotate. This allows you to blend between your scenes and then Rotate to fine-tune the brightness of your scene to perfection. Scene Blender Example 2: Shift Music between rooms or to the entire houseOn each of the 4 scenes you can set each speaker volume to 25%. Push-Rotate to blend between the scenes which will shift the music from one room to another or to the entire house. Use rotate to adjust the volume of the selected speakers.The Selector allows you to select up to 12 custom things to Activate or Adjust. Each position is referred to as clock positions in the app, 1 to 12 o'clock.Things you can AdjustThis allows you to select and adjust the settings of a specific room, the entire house or just a specific device that you want to adjust with Smart Dimming.For example, Push-Rotate to:Things you can ActivateYou predefine your actions and simply execute them. For example, Push-Rotate to:For even more advanced things you can also Activate custom internet requests, Zapier or IFTTT actions and more.\n Adaptive fieldsDepending on the number of actions you set the indicator lights will adapt accordingly. Selecting only two fields will be referred to as Left and Right. Selecting up to four fields will be referred to according to the image below.When using the Scene Blender or Selector it can be helpful to visualize the scenes or functions that have been set to the different positions. The icon sticker-pack add-on comes with a wide variety of different icons to help visualize your scenes.  Flic 2 buttons are included in some of the rewards and can be added as add-ons. Flic 2 was successfully launched here on Kickstarter in 2019 and has since then been continuously improved. Flic 2 can trigger anything that Flic Twist can trigger, but it's just a button without the rotation of Flic Twist. You can assign 3 different triggers to Push, Double Push and Hold. It's really small, wireless and comes with an adhesive that allows you to place it anywhere. Flic 2 runs on a replaceable and included coincell battery, CR2032, that lasts up to two years. Flic Twist and the Flic Hub Mini are fully backwards compatible with Flic Hub and Flic 2. Both Flic Hub LR and Flic 2 buttons will continue to be sold and maintained.Flic Hub Comparison tableThe Flic App for iOS and Android is only required when you set up your Flic Twist for the first time, and if you want to change your settings later. All settings that you make in the app are stored locally in the Flic Hub. Step by Step In the below video we demonstrate the simplicity of adding a Flic Hub and a Flic Twist to the Flic app to start configuring it. In the below video we demonstrate how your existing smart home products, in this case, a Philips Hue lightbulb, are added to the Flic app to be controlled with the Flic Twist. In the below video we show our test bench walking through the setup process step by step and demo the current state of the app and development. As a hacker, you never settle with the features that come out of the box. Flic has always been about empowering customers and provide a way to integrate our product into your personal projects. With HTTP integrations you can add smooth controls to just about anything that runs an HTTP server like your Raspberry Pi-controlled nerf gun turret. Twist to aim and push to shoot with unmatched precision. The one thing we knew before starting the design journey was that Flic Twist needed the ability to rotate. The majority of smart dimmers on the market have Up and Down buttons which are not user-friendly if you’re for example increasing the brightness from 10 to 100%.We evaluated and tested different designs and realized that separating the button and rotation gives the best user experience.We tested a variety of different sizes, from small knobs that you twist with your fingertips to large pucks that you rotate with your entire hand. After more than 10 design iterations we finally settled on the perfect size for the button and the rotating dial which is convenient to use for the entire family.Flic TwistThe Flic Twist is designed with the same Nordic Semiconductor chipset as the Flic 2 button which has Long Range features that give an indoor range of up to 50m. It comes with two replaceable AAA batteries that last up to 2 years. Flic Hub MiniThe new Flic Hub Mini is a very optimized design of our already existing product Flic Hub LR. It uses Bluetooth 5 Low Energy Long Range to communicate with Flic Twist or with other Flic products. One Flic Hub Mini can handle over 60 simultaneous connections to Flic products such as Flic Twist and Flic buttons over a range of up to 50m (150ft). Flic Hub Mini then communicates with your smart home devices using WiFi. There are no limits in how many devices a Flic Hub can control using WiFi. A Flic Hub Mini or a Flic Hub LR are required, even if you use Flic Twist with Matter. The interaction is in the twist, and the brains and logic are in the hub. This setup allows Flic products to be extremely fast and battery efficient, while offering functions that no other products have, still with full privacy. Everything you need to get started is included. Each Flic Twist comes with 2x AAA batteries and wall mount included. The Flic Hub Mini comes with the USB cable included.

Our goal is to bring simplicity to the life of all tech users, from geeks to toddlers. Using your voice or various devices to control your smart home can become frustrating, tiresome, and anti-social. Voice is an excellent tool, but it does not work in all situations. With Flic Twist, we add more options to your hands yet retain the simplicity of the original Flic button. In addition, with Flic Twist, we hope that we can engage all your family members and guests to interact with your smart home while giving you more options to control your smart home.Our JourneyJoacim, one of the Co-Founders of Flic, looked for a simpler way to track his nicotine consumption, so he decided to bring Flic to life. Shortcut Labs was founded in 2013 to create a simple interface - the world's first smart button. The first version of Flic was a great success, as almost ten thousand people backed its campaign.Since the first Flic, we have completed two other successful crowdfunding campaigns. We have shipped over half a million Flic products to 85 countries around the world. Flic integrates with hundreds of technologies we all use daily. Every Flic user has a story to tell about how they use their button. From helping them start their morning routines to be the guardian that keeps their home safe, there are thousands of innovative and imaginative ways Flic is used. But underneath all of them, one thing always remains the same - Flic makes life simple. A shortcut and a life hack that brings smiles to millions of faces every day. Help us make Flic Twist a part of this journey and spread simplicity to even more people worldwide.Privacy PolicyWe take your privacy very seriously. This mindset is also relevant for Flic products. Our products do not have microphones, nor cameras.

                "Text": "Because of the printing effect, the dampened filaments are unsatisfactory. Therefore, as we expected, SUNLU created New Filament Dryer S2.  Compare to the first generation, S2 has a round inner box that has 360 ° constant temperature and uniform heatingMoreover, the design of upper and lower double heating plates increased 30% heating efficiency, so the heating temperature was from a standard 50° C to 70°C which is 20° C higher than similar products on the market. Because the heating speed is more complete and fast, the limitation does not restrict the filament surface. Also, S2 can accept more kinds of filaments and is not limited to several common types. Also, S2 not only can shorten the length of drying consumables into two hours but also dry high-end filaments such as PA/PC.3.42*2.87inch smart touch screen within 0.1-second touch feedback. It can be accurately set even under poor lighting conditions. You can set up the temperature, duration, consumable type, and lighting as well.After the test, the best drying time and temperature are summarized, like PLA, TPU, and PETG, etc. Which reduced the workload of searching consumables setting dates. Cutimazize temperature and times at the touch of a button through the touchscreen.Increasing the bottom-supported by adding four feet in the bottom can improve the function of anti-skid.The four feet in the bottom does not only improve the functionality of anti-skid but also avoids the heat conduction to other objects by adding more space between product and surface.S2 has even more accomplishments. I'm keeping it a secret as long as crowdfunding develops. We are very welcome your perspective, suggestions, and comments. Also, your advice motivates us to improve!To prevent moisture, each 3D printing filament is dried and vacuumed before shipping. Because of the printing effect, the dampened filaments are unsatisfactory. However, we cannot predict if the filaments can be finished at once, so the rest of the filaments will be dampened.───── \"Hi, Kickstarter! This is SUNLU official group.

                "Title": "Monotype Electro Type Matrix: 3D Model and 3D Print",
                "Text": "This small campaign is focused on a single type artifact: the Monotype Electro Display Matrix, developed by the Monotype Company in the early 1900s to cast large multiples of individual pieces of type. The funds raised by the campaign cover the cost of producing an accurate 3D model of a single matrix, suitable for 3D output, and making 3D prints to fulfill campaign rewards.Understanding the past often requires the means to study it. In my research over the last several years into the history of printing and typefounding and typesetting, I’ve collected many artifacts that give me insight into how things were made and how that affected publishing, design, and the spread of information.Many printing artifacts are in short supply, as they haven’t been manufactured in several decades or much longer. To gain access to limited tools, you can make fresh copies of them—and 3D scanning, modeling, and printing is a fantastic modern technique that can bring the past back to life. I need your help to produce and refine a model of the Electro Display Matrix and release it in the world. When the campaign concludes, you can follow updates both posted here and at the Tiny Type Blog.Campaign backers will receive the 3D file first. But to further cultural and technological understanding, six months after backers get access, I will distribute the file under a Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 license, which permits any use with attribution, allowing its wide distribution. This will allow others with the interest to have a perfected model to reproduce or build from without starting from scratch.Reward tiers include:This project is the first foray into what I hope will be a future series of 3D models of printing artifacts. I drew inspiration for this project from the 3Dhotbed teaching tools developed as a collaboration of the Texas A&M University Book History Workshop, Cushing Memorial Library, and Texas A&M University.Because I don’t yet have the model made, I can’t show you what they would look like. However, I can show an example of something comparable, the type punch from the 3Dhotbed project. In the image below, this is how the model appears in 3D-printer preparation software, as a print in PLA material, and as a 3D print in metal.The Electro Display Matrix is one of several kinds of molds (or matrices) used to create type by casting it in a liquid lead alloy, which fills the mold and quickly cools and hardens. The size and type of mold varied with the point size of the type. The Electro Display Matrix was used for display type, from 14 to 36 points.A type-foundry worker would mount the Electro Display Matrix into a holder and place it in a specialized typecasting machine. They could then monitor the machine as it produced hundreds to thousands identical pieces of metal type per hour. Each piece would emerge in its nearly finished condition, ready to be added to a font—a set of metal type at a specific size in one style—and shipped off to a printer or put in storage for future orders.The Electro Display Matrix is a thing of beauty, containing two types of metal and involving machining, stamping, and an electrochemical deposition process called electrotyping.In electrotyping, a model of what the finished piece of metal type should look like is inserted into a cavity in a piece of machined and stamped bronze. The process deposits copper onto the model, forming the mold when the model is removed. See images for illustrations of this process.Each number on the mold refers to the font of which it is part, its width, its size, and other technical characteristics. The finished matrix’s dimensions are 1.125 by .75 by 0.094 inches. Beveled edges allowed it to be locked into place in the casting machine.Electrotyping allowed a massive increase in the variety and production of type in the latter half of the 19th century and Monotype and other companies further accelerated that by creating a standardized mold to cast type.Some modern experimenters have replicated the process on a very limited scale, as producing these molds in quantity required industrial operations.This campaign will pay for the cost of 3D scanning, modeling, and prototyping a copy of a single matrix. I am working with two established 3D modeling firms that have produced work of similar complexity from original objects and provided binding estimates. (Because the project hit its goal early, the matrices are already off for scanning and at two different companies for comparison and to improve the odds of an initial positive outcome.)Part of your pledge supports releasing the 3D model for broad use without fee or restriction.The commitment of this campaign is that the matrix will be 3D-printed in PLA (polylactic acid), a hard plastic-like material. However, depending on the final costs of production and the volume of items ordered, I hope to be able to upgrade that to 3D printing in some form of metal. All backers who pledge for a 3D-printed matrix will receive the upgrade if the budget allows for it.Many Monotype matrices remain in use at active type foundries around the world, such as M&H Type in San Francisco (part of the non-profit Grabhorn Institute) and the Bixler Press & Letterfoundry in New York. However, I regularly come across small sets of Electro Display Matrices that are not in the right condition for typecasting. A cleaned-up matrix from a recovered set is part of the higher-tier rewards, like the one shown below. (My intent is never to remove material from circulation that could be used by active letterpress printers or type foundries.) This campaign will help preserve the past, spread knowledge about the technology, and give backers a unique replica or actual piece of printing history.Backers at the top tier will receive two 3D-printed and two historic Electro Display Type matrices and one Super Caster master, of the kind shown below.Shipments within the United States: This project’s reward prices include sales tax for shipments made to addresses within Washington State in the United States.Shipments outside the United States: I do not collect GST, VAT, or import duties for items shipped outside the United States. You may be required to pay the delivery company taxes or duties when physical items arrive in your country. These often range from between 10% to 25%, depending on the country.",

                "Title": "PiBox: A Modular Raspberry Pi Storage Server",
                "Text": "PiBox is a purpose built storage server (NAS) designed for running self-hosted applications at your home & office, runs 24/7, and uses very little power. Storage is modular, and allows you to add any two SATA compatible SSDs.Powered by Raspberry PiThe Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 is at the core of PiBox. Our standard bundle includes 8GB of RAM, 8GB of built-in storage, and WiFi. If you pick the hacker bundle reward (i.e. carrier boards only), you will need to supply your own CM4, which is available in 32 variants, with a range of RAM, eMMC Flash, and WiFi options. A Micro SD card slot is present on the PiBox boards, so you are able to use the \"Lite\" variants without onboard storage.Hacker FriendlyWith a Raspberry Pi at the core, PiBox is the most hackable NAS on the market. We broke out the GPIO pins so you can wire up sensors and Pi HATs, and even included a header for 2 extra USB ports in case you want to install it in a larger case. On the front panel, there's a user-controllable RGB LED and a 1.3\" LCD that you can use for displaying any information you want.Better than the CloudReplace expensive cloud bills with PiBox. PiBox lets you easily migrate from Google Photos to PhotoPrism, or from DropBox to Nextcloud, and many more. Pibox runs new self-hosted applications at the click of a button.This video shows how you can install PhotoPrism on your PiBox:Powered by KubeSailKubeSail is optional software that helps youWe built KubeSail in order to make it easy to self-host apps, wherever they live. We ship KubeSail software with PiBox and hope you enjoy it, but you are never locked in or forced to use it. PiBox is deeply rooted in an open ecosystem and we have instructions on how to flash your PiBox from scratch if you enjoy tinkering!Customizable LCD Display and LEDsBy default, the front of PiBox shows important stats about your PiBox. You can customize the screen to show anything else, such as the Weather, Tweets, or even your favorite cat GIFs. The top indicator is a tri-color RGB LED, wired to three separate GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi, so its easy to customize. Install some software that takes advantage of these features, or write your own!Silent OperationThe PiBox emits a PWM control signal so the fan only spins as fast as necessary. This makes it quieter than even the Official Raspberry Pi Case fan, and keeps the CPU from experiencing large temperature swings, which should lead to longer CPU life for your Pi. Typically this is done via a dedicated controller chip that is impossible to buy currently, due to the ongoing chip shortage. But thanks to some clever code from alwynallan on GitHub, we are able to ship a silent PiBox now, with no delays.Open, Hackable, and UpgradableThe PiBox is designed to be opened. All the components are modular and upgradable, including the backplane and carrier board. For example, this means that you can continue to use the expensive Raspberry Pi Compute Module and SSDs, even if you later decide you need a PiBox with more ports, or a larger front display.DIY Edition (Hacker Bundle) - 10 Minute Assembly VideoThis video shows the assembly instructions for the DIY edition of PiBox. In this reward tier, we provide the carrier and backplane boards, and the rest is up to you. You will need to provide your own Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4, Cooling Fan, 15W+ USB-C Power Supply, CM4 WiFi Antenna,  1.3\" LCD Display, Case (3D Printed or Metal), and one or two SSD drives.Meet the CreatorsHi there! We're Dan and Seandon. After becoming friends while working and scaling up servers at Imgur, we founded the startup KubeSail with a goal of making home-hosting awesome. The most common complaint we kept hearing is that it was a hassle to get good home server hardware (existing options were too small and slow, or too big and loud). We designed a fits-in-the-palm-of-your-hand server based on the latest Raspberry Pi CM4 and ultra-fast SSDs, and you can customize it! - Buy the stand-alone hardware or combine it with KubeSail.com for apps, dynamic DNS, web-forwarding, backups and more!",

                "Title": "Personomic — Custom-made bike grips with high durability",
                "Text": "The bike grip from Personomic is the last grip you will ever need: 3D printed to fit your hand, made of 100% silicone to prevent stickiness and customized by you according to your design preferences.Hand discomfort will be a thing of the past with your own custom-made bike grip.During the development of the grips, we took advantage of our network of people specialized in ergonomics as well as people with a medical background.Independent studies have shown that Personomic grips excel at reducing the pressure load on the hands, thus preventing and reducing common cycling-related hand issues. The grips fit on almost any handlebar because they are standardized and to top it off, they are 100% made in Germany as a guarantee for their quality.As a cyclist, the problem is all too familiar: whether it's the saddle or the bike handle, you often have to deal with numbness, tingling or pain that can really ruin the cycling experience.Until now, bicycle grips have only been offered in standard sizes, developed with an average-sized hand in mind. Therefore, these grips only constitute a compromise. For many people it is mostly a bad one, because every hand is different.In addition, the vast majority of bicycle grips are made of rubber and start to become sticky after a short time. This is caused by the plasticizers contained in the material, which dissolve from the handle due to UV radiation and sweat.Our solution turns the bicycle grip market on its head: a bike grip that is 3D printed to fit the individual cyclist with just a photo of the hand, therefore providing optimum support. The grip is made of silicone, which contains no plasticizers, therefore it will never become sticky and will last for many years.The bike grip from Personomic is custom-made for your hands. We take the individual characteristics of your hand into account, such as the width and length of your fingers and your palm. This allows for a perfect fit. The force is distributed evenly across your hand and there are no pressure peaks that compress the nerves — similar to an orthopaedic insole.The enlarged surface with the wing also supports your wrist and prevents hyperextension, one of the main reasons for numb or tingling fingers.Regular bike grips made of rubber quickly start to become sticky because of the plasticizers they contain.We have recognized this problem and therefore use silicone, because it is extremely abrasion-resistant and guaranteed not to become sticky – you will be able to enjoy your grips for years.We specify the shape of the grip and you design it. You can let your creativity run wild with the design and choose from over 350 design combinations. Choose the color, texture and lock rings. You can even have the handle engraved, making your dream grip unique to you. We use only the best materials and manufacture in Germany to offer a premium grip. With the company Rapid Shape, we have gained one of the world's leading manufacturers of 3D printing systems as a partner to guarantee the best possible quality in production.— These reviews have been translated from German to English —From the outset, we have developed the bike grips with passionate cyclists and have incorporated their feedback into the development. This allowed us to develop a grip that is tailored precisely to the needs of cyclists.I have now tested the bike grips extensively and their shape is just incredible. I've never experienced such a pleasant grip before and I've run through lots in the past. I tore a ligament in my left hand 2 months ago due to a fall. With the bike grips there are no issues whatsoever. They support the injured hand really well. — Hjalmar P. from BochumI didn't feel any tingling or numbness in my hands. My problems stem from my thumb basal joint because of arthritis, but that also became much, much better. On longer tours they have always hurt a lot, but with the new grips there was a lot of improvement. — Silvia A. from KirfThe different surfaces (asphalt, gravel) did not lead to any (negative) changes in my hands ... the bike grips simply \"swallowed\" the vibrations, which I personally find important.... Conclusion: if the grips are positioned correctly, they bring (me) noticeable relief. The problems with my hands have become significantly better, even on long-distance tours. — Susanne K. from MuensterOn Facebook, the young start-up Personomic was looking for testers for their custom-made and ergonomic bicycle grips. With a bit of luck, I was chosen as a tester due to my history of rheumatism and have now been testing these grips for 4 weeks and about 400 km. I am absolutely thrilled how these grips have improved my \"cycling life\". — Andreas K. from SchwalbachThe reviews of our testers are confirmed by pressure analyses. In a study conducted by the University of Stuttgart, our custom-made bicycle grips were compared with six other ergonomic grips available on the market.Force measurements showed that compared to conventional bicycle grips, our grips are the best at reducing both the pressure peaks on the palm as well as the surface pressure.In addition to the grips, you can order end plugs and lock rings as add-ons to use them as spare parts if needed. This is how you get your grips:Before your grips go into production, we will ask you to scan your hands on our website. All you need is a smartphone with which you can take a photo of each hand on a sheet of paper. The photos will then be sent to us.We are compatible with both DIN-A4 and US letter formats.After you have successfully scanned your hands, you can design the grip according to your own design preferences in the configurator.  We can measure your hand with just one photo. The sheet of paper serves as a reference object whose exact dimensions we know. With your hand measurements, we then create a freely movable 3D model of your hand.Similar to orthopaedic insoles, our software creates a virtual imprint of your hand including the palm rest and grip recesses.\n We then print a mold that has the shape of your hand and cast it with silicone. The result is a bike grip that fits your hand perfectly and will never become sticky.* Handlebars are standardized. You can measure yours if you are unsure.** We plan to offer shortened grips for grip shifters in 2022.Please note that you will be responsible for any potential import duties, taxes and customs fees after the shipment arrives in your country (not valid if you reside in the EU).After the end of the crowdfunding campaign and before the start of production, you will be asked to scan your hands as well as choose the design of your grips. During this process, you will also be able to set your delivery address.Do you want to give your loved ones a really unique present for christmas or their birthday? In this case, we provide you with a printable voucher in a design suitable for the occasion.You will receive the download link in time by e-mail.We love cycling and believe that bikes as a means of transport can contribute to climate protection and make our cities more livable. However, common cycling-related hand discomfort is a problem because it limits people's ability to ride their bikes. That's why we use high-tech 3D printers to enable people to ride their bikes without any discomfort.When we met in 2020 just when the COVID-19 pandemic started, we were faced with the question of how to proceed in our lives. Due to the uncertainty, it was obvious that we should use the crisis to start our own company.We created the first prototype of the bicycle grip using impression material that is usually used by dentists. Through these experiments, a rough shape for the bicycle grip emerged quickly. Finally, we set the final design after many iterations.We were already on German national TV with our grips. Moreover, we were able to present our grips to thousands of cyclists at the VELOFrankfurt and Eurobike bike fairs. The feedback we received was overwhelming.With your help, we now want to make the bicycle grips available to as many people as possible!Der Fahrradgriff von Personomic ist der letzte Griff, den du brauchen wirst: im 3D-Druck individuell auf deine Hand angepasst, gefertigt aus 100 % Silikon gegen lästiges Verkleben und außerdem von dir nach deinen Vorlieben designbar.Mit deinem eigenen maßgefertigten Fahrradgriff gehören Handbeschwerden der Vergangenheit an.Während der Entwicklung der Griffe konnten wir auf unser Netzwerk, bestehend aus Ergonomiespezialisten sowie Personen mit medizinischem Hintergrund, zurückgreifen.Unabhängige Studien haben gezeigt, dass Personomic-Griffe die Druckbelastung auf die Hände hervorragend reduzieren und damit Handproblemen, die beim Radfahren häufig auftreten, vorbeugen bzw. diese reduzieren.Die Griffe passen auf fast alle Lenkerstangen, da diese standardisiert sind. Außerdem sind sie zu 100 % in Deutschland hergestellt, was für ihre Qualität bürgt.Bekannt aus: Als Fahrradfahrer kennt man das Problem. Ob beim Sattel oder beim Fahrradgriff, oft hat man es mit Taubheitsgefühlen, Kribbeln oder Schmerzen zu tun, die einem das Fahrradfahren richtig vermiesen können.Fahrradgriffe werden bisher nur in Standardgrößen angeboten, die im Hinblick auf eine Durchschnittshand entwickelt wurden. Dadurch stellen sie nur einen Kompromiss dar. Für viele Leute meistens einen Schlechten, weil jede Hand anders ist.Darüber hinaus wird die große Mehrheit der Fahrradgriffe aus Gummi hergestellt und fängt nach kurzer Zeit an, klebrig zu werden. Das liegt an den enthaltenen Weichmachern, die sich aufgrund der UV-Strahlung und Schweiß aus dem Griff lösen. Unsere Lösung stellt den Markt für Fahrradgriffe auf den Kopf: Ein Fahrradgriff, der mit nur einem Foto der Hand im 3D-Druck auf den jeweiligen Fahrer angepasst wird und die Hand optimal entlastet. Durch das Aufgießen mit Silikon, welches keine Weichmacher enthält, wird der Griff nie verkleben und viele Jahre halten. Der Fahrradgriff von Personomic wird für deine Hände maßgefertigt. Wir berücksichtigen dabei die individuellen Merkmale deiner Hand, wie z. B. die Breite und Länge deiner Finger und deines Handtellers. Dadurch entsteht ein perfekter Fit.Die Kraft wird gleichmäßig auf deine Hand verteilt, und es kommt zu keinen Belastungsspitzen, die die Nerven in deiner Hand komprimieren — ähnlich wie bei einer orthopädischen Schuheinlage.Der Entlastungsflügel stützt außerdem dein Handgelenk und verhindert so ein Abknicken, einer der Hauptgründe für taube oder kribbelnde Finger.Normale Fahrradgriffe aus Gummi fangen aufgrund der darin enthaltenen Weichmacher schnell an, klebrig zu werden.Wir haben dieses Problem erkannt und verwenden deshalb Silikon, weil es extrem abriebfest ist und garantiert nicht verklebt — du hast jahrelang Freude daran.Wir geben die Form des Griffs vor und du designst ihn. Du kannst deiner Kreativität beim Design freien Lauf lassen und aus über 350 Designkombinationen wählen. Ob Farbe, Klemmring oder Textur — am Ende kommt ein einzigartiger Griff heraus. Dafür garantiert auch eine Gravur, die du wählen kannst. Wir verwenden nur die besten Materialien und produzieren selbst in Deutschland, um einen wirklichen Premium-Griff anzubieten. Mit der Firma Rapid Shape haben wir einen der weltweit führenden Anbieter für 3D-Druck-Systeme als Partner gewonnen, um die bestmögliche Qualität in der Produktion zu garantieren.Wir haben die Fahrradgriffe von Anfang an mit leidenschaftlichen Radfahrern entwickelt und haben deren Feedback mit in die Entwicklung einfließen lassen. Dadurch konnten wir einen Griff entwickeln, der exakt auf die Bedürfnisse von Fahrradfahrern abgestimmt ist. Ich habe die Griffe jetzt ausführlich getestet und die Form ist einfach mega. So angenehm war noch kein Griff und ich habe einige durch. Ich hatte vor 2 Monaten durch einen Sturz einen Bänderabriss an der linken Problemhand. Mit den Griffen habe ich null Probleme. Die verletzte Hand ist richtig gut gestützt. — Hjalmar P. aus BochumIch hatte keinerlei Kribbeln oder Taubheitsgefühl in meinen Händen. Mein Hauptproblem sind aber immer meine Daumengrundgelenke wegen Arthrose, aber auch das war viel, viel besser. Bei längeren Touren haben die schon immer sehr geschmerzt, aber mit den neuen Griffen war das wirklich deutlich besser. — Silvia A. aus KirfDie unterschiedlichen Untergründe (Asphalt, Schotter) führten zu keiner (negativen) Veränderung meiner Hände … die Griffe haben das einfach „geschluckt“, was ich persönlich wichtig finde. ... Fazit: Wenn die Handgriffe richtig positioniert sind, bringen sie (mir) eine spürbare Erleichterung, so dass meine Handprobleme deutlich weniger sind — auch über eine längere Strecke. — Susanne K. aus MünsterBei Facebook wurden von dem jungen Start-Up Unternehmen Personomic Tester für ihre maßgefertigten und ergonomischen Fahrradgriffe gesucht. Mit etwas Glück wurde ich mit meiner Rheuma-Vorgeschichte als Tester ausgesucht und teste diese Griffe jetzt seit 4 Wochen und ca. 400 km. Ich bin absolut begeistert, wie diese Griffe mir mein „Fahrradleben“ wieder verbessert haben. — Andreas K. aus SchwalbachDie Erfahrungsberichte unserer Tester werden von Druckanalysen bestätigt. In einer Studie der Universität Stuttgart wurden unsere maßgefertigten Fahrradgriffe mit sechs weiteren am Markt erhältlichen ergonomischen Griffen verglichen.Motorische Kraftmessungen ergaben, dass unsere Griffe sowohl die Kraftspitzen auf die Handfläche als auch die Flächenpressung am besten reduzieren.Zusätzlich zu den Griffen kannst du als Add-ons noch weitere Endstopfen und Klemmringe als Ersatz oder farbliche Ergänzung bestellen. So kommst du zu deinem Griff:Bevor deine Griffe in Produktion gehen, scannst du deine Hände auf unserer Webseite. Du brauchst dafür nur ein Smartphone, mit dem du ein Foto jeder Hand auf einem DIN-A4-Blatt machst. Die Fotos werden im Anschluss an uns übermittelt. Nachdem du deine Hände erfolgreich gescannt hast, kannst du im Konfigurator den Griff ganz nach deinen Wünschen designen. \n Mit dem Foto deiner Hand können wir deine Hand millimetergenau vermessen. Das DIN-A4-Blatt dient uns dabei als Referenzobjekt, dessen Maße wir kennen. Mit deinen Handmaßen erstellen wir ein frei bewegliches 3D-Modell deiner Hand.Ähnlich wie bei orthopädischen Schuheinlagen erstellt unsere Software einen virtuellen Abdruck deiner Hand samt Handballenauflage und Griffmulden.Wir drucken im Anschluss eine Gussform, die die Form deiner Hand hat, und gießen sie mit Silikon auf. Das Ergebnis ist ein Fahrradgriff, der perfekt zu deiner Hand passt und nie verkleben wird.* Lenkerstangen sind standardisiert. Miss gerne nach, falls du unsicher bist.** Wir planen, nach dem Crowdfunding im regulären Verkauf verkürzte Griffe für Drehgriffschaltungen anzubieten. Bitte beachte, dass du für eventuell anfallende Zollgebühren oder erhobene Mehrwertsteuer verantwortlich bist (gilt nicht mit Wohnsitz in der EU). Nach Ablauf der Kampagne und vor Start der Produktion wirst du nach dem Scannen deiner Hände und Konfigurieren deiner Griffe die Möglichkeit haben, deine Lieferanschrift zu hinterlegen. Willst du einem dir lieben Menschen zu Weihnachten oder zum Geburtstag ein wirklich einzigartiges Geschenk machen? Für diesen Fall stellen wir dir einen ausdruckbaren Gutschein im passenden Design zur Verfügung.Den Link zum Download erhältst du rechtzeitig per E-Mail.Wir lieben Fahrradfahren und glauben, dass das Fahrrad als Fortbewegungsmittel einen Teil zum Klimaschutz beitragen und unsere Städte lebenswerter machen kann. Weitverbreitete Handbeschwerden sind da natürlich ein Problem, weil sie die Fahrer unnötig einschränken. Wir benutzen deshalb High-Tech, um Menschen beschwerdefreies Fahrradfahren zu ermöglichen.Als wir uns 2020 kennenlernten, standen wir pünktlich zum Beginn der Coronapandemie vor der Frage, wie es beruflich bei uns weitergehen soll. Aufgrund der Unsicherheit war nichts naheliegender, als die Krise zu nutzen, um ein eigenes Unternehmen zu gründen.Den ersten Prototypen des Fahrradgriffs erstellten wir noch mit Abformmasse, wie sie bei Zahnärzten Verwendung findet. Durch diese Versuche kristallisierte sich schnell eine grobe Form für den Fahrradgriff heraus. In vielen Iterationsstufen kamen wir dann zum finalen Design des Griffs.Mit unseren Griffen waren wir drei Mal im Fernsehen zu sehen, u. a. in der SWR Landesschau und bei „Einfach genial“ im MDR. Auf der VELOFrankfurt und Eurobike konnten wir außerdem tausenden Fahrradfahrern vor Ort unsere Griffe präsentieren. Das Feedback war überwältigend.Gemeinsam mit dir wollen wir jetzt die Fahrradgriffe einer breiten Masse an Menschen zur Verfügung stellen!This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 2,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $900M raised between them.",

All rewards will be sent fully tracked & insured. **EUROPEAN UNION ONLY - IMPORTANT** Due to the recent exit of the UK from the EU all items to the EU must be sent \"DDU\" - Delivery Duty Unpaid. All EU recipients will be liable for any import / customs duties / charges that your country will impose. These rates vary within the EU but roughly equate to Approx. 20-25% of the combined value of the goods & shipping + handling fees - typically of around €15. We are sorry for this unfortunate situation and will do our best to ship all reward 'gifts' in a way that minimizes recipient costs. For some regions (e.g., Brazil) we may need you to supply additional information, e.g., CNPJ / CPF numbers. We will contact you directly in due course if this applies to your pledge.Redkey works on most Windows™ compatible Desktops & Laptop computers made since 2000, and most Intel-processor-based Apple computers made between 2006 and 2019. Redkey is not compatible with 'Apple silicon' computers. Specifically - any 'non-Intel processor' based systems such as power PC and proprietary M1 architectures. Redkey 'Ultimate' works on most Apple Cell Phones and Tablets, and has been tested successfully on most models. Redkey Ultimate also works on most Android Cell Phones and tablets, made by various manufacturers, running Android software versions ranging from 3-12. Exact processes may vary. Access to compatible USB ports is required as well as a genuine data cable. Some devices will require system configuration before use. Exceptions apply. Minimal computer system requirements apply X86/X64 & min. 1GB RAM. Min. 4GB system RAM is needed to utilize the remote wipe mode. Redkey is not rated for specific specialist / commercial equipment such as servers, data center hardware, network disk arrays & virtual computers (although we are working on it).

                "Text": "Have you ever had a friend ask if you’ve seen a certain natural feature on a trail near your hometown, or if you knew where such and such a place got its name? Maybe you've heard them talking about this amazing place they visited and what they experienced there, but you were never able to find that place on your own.  I have experienced all of the above.  It can be frustrating and discouraging.  But, it doesn’t have to be.  You will no longer be getting lost, missing out, be left wondering, have to turn back, or break the bank paying for a guide.Explore Galore is a free downloadable app that helps individuals and agencies create fun, informative, and educational audio tours recorded by professional voice actors. GPS recognizes where you are on the trail and prompts the next audio clip.  It also uses QR codes on trail markers that can prompt content.  We want to create trails all over the world, in every community, and encourage people to get out and explore the world around them.In Phase 1 we will create a community of users that can build their own pacing guides, act as virtual hiking partners, and obtain followers and passive income.  All users will be able to track progress, complete challenges, earn badges and rewards and view leaderboards.   It will also provide the opportunity for individuals to create their own personal family history tours to preserve important memories.  Phase 2 includes the official audio tours and the TRAILS Initiative (Teaching Responsibility And Independent Learning Skills).  During this phase of development, we will reach out to municipalities, agencies, schools and other interested parties to collaborate and build official audio tours for their respective communities.  Explore Galore will provide physical signs (trail markers) for hiking trails and work with agencies and local professionals to include quality content about wildlife, plants, historic events, etc.  Contributors for these tours will earn a fixed percentage of every download!  These official audio tours may be hiking trails, city tours, river rafting expeditions, snowshoe or nordic ski areas, ATV trail rides, or aviation tours with pre-planned flight paths.The idea is simple.  The app will be simple and easy to use and this service is not available anywhere else.  You want to hike the Appalachian Trail and learn about everything along the way, but there’s no audio tour yet?  That’s ridiculous!  Explore Galore audio tours will be everywhere you want to go and others will be sharing their trail experiences for those that choose to subscribe to the additional material.Explore Galore will be like the Peloton of the hiking community.  You can learn things for the first time that you would never know going alone, or we can be your built-in fitness tracker, fitness guide, and virtual hiking partner for an enhanced experience. The trails and history already exist. With outdoor recreation on the rise and people wanting more information, we need Explore Galore to provide this quality service that no one else is providing.  Everyone needs a hiking partner, whether for education, entertainment or just encouragement. Explore Galore can provide all three. There are 118 million hikers worldwide and a world of people feeling isolated, lonely, disconnected, and trapped in a small life.  We want to free people from the stress, fear, and loneliness by providing opportunity to explore the world around them and discover it's hidden treasures.Through well planned and creative initiatives we can further our reach quickly while promoting community service through our initiatives like HIKE (Hikers Investing In Kindness Everywhere) where local volunteers will be able to share VR tours of actual trails with other, less abled individuals.  With the expertise and ongoing support of esteemed app designers, we can provide the most comprehensive audio tour app on the market.Our mission is to help create a world where people seek a greater understanding of one another and the value of life by encouraging people to explore the diversity of the world, learn, and develop an appreciation through understanding, compassion, and connection. In order to fulfill this mission, we need funding for the app development.We are currently in the discovery phase of development with Algoworks, a company full of technology experts.  Algoworks has been recognized among the best technology companies by Deloitte & Silicon India, ranking in the top ten for 2021!  They have developed over 500 apps for startups and Fortune 500 companies and have outlined a detailed statement of work for this project spanning a period of 5 months. We intend to release the beta version of the app in the summer of 2022 for input to  our Diamond sponsors. Finally, I want to thank  Mr. Brant Pinvidic, author of \"The 3 Minute Rule\" who has been very helpful in supporting our vision. Brant has been a great resource and support to continue in our endeavor but we need your help. Transcend The Trail with us!",

                "Text": "History/Story.My name is Almonzer Assad from Sudan, African and I’m an Electrical Engineer at the University Of Sudan with an interest/passion for building and designing EV (Electrical Vehicles). For as long as I could remember I loved Bicycles. I loved how they look, the joy it brings people, the community it creates, and the peace that comes with riding bicycles. Growing up Bicycles were the main means of transportation. So I remember how peaceful and quiet it was growing up as the only noises you’d hear are either birds or the familiar bicycle bell ring. Now you can’t even hear the birds as the loud car and motorbike engines took over as the means of transportation.The name of my company is Flip. What I make is Electric Bicycles. The million dollar question is why bicycles? This idea came after the tragic events that happened/happening in Sudan since 2018. As a massive petroleum/gas shortage hit the country the prices for this good skyrocketed. This led to many people losing their jobs as means of transportation became almost non-existent. Not only were jobs impacted even worse, kids could not go to school as well. The country was shut down and life stopped all because there were no alternatives.  Then people started using bicycles as means of transportation which worked for some and for some it was almost impossible because of the distance they would have to cover.These events are what led me to this point right now. I decided if I could make electric bicycles that could be affordable for the average household that would not only lead to a cleaner country, it will also mean life would not have to stop if such tragedies occur again The world is evolving at a fast rate and the sad truth is Africa is behind, and so has been the case for decades now. When I watch people like Elon Musk take on the industry and lead the way for a cleaner world I ask myself why can’t I? The world needs change, especially Africa.The Budget:As seen in the video I already have a functioning prototype. Most of the money will go into purchasing more bicycles and developing better prototypes.Cost Category Description Phase Expected TotalIncludes buying new bicycles and development of better prototypesMaking$8,000.00_______________________________________________________________Making$500.00_______________________________________________________________This is the shipping cost for the bicycles as I plan to buy in large quantityMaking$3,000_______________________________________________________________This is the time I plan to put in to assemble the bicyclesOther$200.00TOTAL with taxes = $14,300.00Timeline1.

                "Text": "#New Review Video UpdatedWe all know that there’s just no good and safe enough way to keep our ears as clean as they should be—earwax buildup is a serious concern. Q-tips, ear picks, and other accessories may help, but they may also cause some pain and be less than effective.Healthy ears need to be clean and cleared from accumulated earwax. However, scheduling an appointment with a doctor to have your ears cleaned is not always easy—your busy schedule doesn’t help, or sometimes your family budget will just refuse to stretch.  With BOCOOLIFE, you can simply use a device with lukewarm water that will clean your ears, making them healthier, without having to waste time and money on appointments you don’t really want to schedule. It also allows you to make sure that your ear won’t be exposed to devices that medical doctors may use on other patients.  BOCOOLIFE Ear Cleaner works exclusively through its irrigation system that is designed to deliver a safe and effective electrically powered stable water flow. BOCOOLIFE simply uses the volume and pressure of water to push extremely deep and tenacious wax out of your ears. There’s no pressure against the tympanic membrane and no risk to your ears.      The safe, pain-free, and extremely effective ear cleaner and irrigation system that keeps your family’s ears clean  Basically, the person whose ears are being cleaned will feel as if a water stream is flowing into her ear and coming right out. A very mild sensation of discomfort could be experienced—just because the cerumen is being pushed away from the ear through partial dilution and water pressure. The  Q-tip will push the ear wax back into the ear canal which might hurt the eardrum and cause infection.Different requirements and preferences call for different pressure levels, which is why BOCOOLIFE features four modes that you can choose from based on your needs.   With 4 LED lights and a transparent acrylic water barrier with zoom function, let you observe the ear canal more clearly, and prevent splash. Your ears are delicate and exposing them directly to equipment used by others is not a sterile and recommended way to clean them. That's why the BOCOOLIFE Ear Cleaner and Irrigation System comes with multiple single-use soft ear tips to ensure that each ear tip belongs to you alone and to avoid cross-contamination. Using BOCOOLIFE Ear Cleaner causes mostly no pain whatsoever. Its design and way of working are made for a perfectly safe ear cleaning operation that even unskilled users can quickly master. No side effects are to be expected from an ear cleaning intervention with BOCOOLIFE because this device uses only lukewarm water to effectively clean your ears.Providing an ergonomic water container that fits well on the shoulders and you could place it on your shoulders to hold the water leftover from the ear washing. You will have a better experience if your friend or family could help you with this!When designing BOCOOLIFE, we wanted to make sure that the battery was one of its strengths. That’s why we equipped it with a 2000mAh rechargeable lithium battery that charges quickly, ensuring lasting charge cycles for multiple cleaning operations. Once full charge can use for up to 8 hours!Your BOCOOLIFE’s battery is here to help you keep your family’s ears—and yours—clean for a long time!The Conventional need to constantly repeat the squeezing operation and it might take a long time to clean your earwax. Moreover, it is difficult to clean stubborn earwax effectively. It would be dangerous, the ear tip needs to be inserted into the ear canal and is easily dislodged.BOCOOLIFE Ear Cleaner works exclusively through its irrigation system that is designed to deliver a safe and effective electrically powered stable water flow. BOCOOLIFE simply uses the volume and pressure of water to push extremely deep and tenacious wax out of your ears. There’s no pressure against the tympanic membrane and no risk to your ears—unlike damage that could be caused by other devices, which require an inefficient and harsh manual squeeze and rinse operation.However, if there's a history of ear perforations, ear surgeries, or ear-related pain recently experienced, then BOCOOLIFE should not be used, and you should consult a medical doctor to have your ears cleaned in a clinically recommended way. The story of BOCOOLIFE began in 2016 when founders Sam(an Audiologist) and Alex( a Design Engineer) met. Their first venture was the BOCOOLIFE Ear Cleaner with Irrigation System, and they started with the mission that  \" easy and effective ear care solution\" This mission hasn't changed to this day, despite the brand's global success and wide range of ear care products offerings. BOCOOLIFE has believed that ear irrigation or ear syringing is a much better solution than cotton swabs, it's true, clean with cotton swabs merely pushes the wax deeper into the ear canal, causing a blockage. So, it should be cleaned in an easy and efficient way. After long-term market research, BOCOOLIFE team decided to develop an innovative and unique ear irrigation kit -  BOCOOLIFE Ear Cleaner with Irrigation System. It's powerful, durable, easy, and comfortable without hurting to clean ear blockage at home for all ages. The core concept remains the same: A breakthrough in-ear health - cleaning alone is not enough!Factory ImageThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarter launches with 1,400+ successful Kickstarter projects and over $500M raised in total.",

Blincc Hex will dynamically spin and always be there reflecting headlights. It gets you noticed while still being sleek!But... Isn't reflective decal already normal? So why Blincc Hex? Good question. Let's take a look at it.1. Super durable with an enhanced protective layer.2. Thin & flexible to follow complex profiles and edges. 3. Customised 3M micro prismatic brightness.4. Modular design.5. Most importantly, simply awesome.Previously we were using glass beads technology which is flexible. However, after more and more tests we managed to find a better option. We are all familiar with the 3M micro prismatic performance. Blincc Hex is made of customized 3M micro prismatic which is super bright yet it is extremely malleable. Normally micro prismatic will crack on sharp bent. However, Blincc Hex custom prismatic can even be folded! it is the best of both worlds :)We know outdoor can be rough due to particles such as carbon, dust, gravel, debris, and more. So, Blincc Hex is enhanced with an extra engineered protective layer to shield it from potential harm. Would you look at that!We love curves. So does Blincc Hex. Have a sharp aero curve and edges? Don't worry, Blincc Hex will fit in.As mentioned, It will even follow folds!Due to the shape, Blincc Hex will appear different just by pasting it slightly differently. your style your move. Additionally, due to the modularity, any broken pcs during use can easily be changed without replacing the whole set. Decided to go off-road for a shortcut on a muddy path? no worries, it is easy to clean.Whether you are rocking on normal brakes or advanced disc brakes, Blincc Hex won't discriminate. Its size allows pasting on tight spaces easily.Worry less about fitting and sizes, We have designed Blincc Hex to fit virtually any bike due to its size and shape. You can still get Blincclip in this campaign as a bundle.No Early Bird Price? Fortunately no. Here is why:Early birds create a perception of urgency. It may be great for creators' sales but we do not want to trigger your impulsive buying for our advantage.

                "Text": "Help back this pioneering project….  Are any of you avid crafters? Does anyone (like myself) hoard craft supplies? With the success of some well-known marketplaces online, there is nothing out there solely to buy, sell and destash craft supplies. Research suggests there are a large number of different social media platforms, groups, pages and marketplaces where you can buy, sell and destash craft supplies, but no stand alone “one stop shop” designed specifically.  I would like to change that and create The Craft Exchange. It would be the only marketplace specifically where you can buy, sell and destash craft supplies and not only that, I want to create the Craft Exchange community. A community where like-minded crafters can meet up online and chat about anything craft related, share ideas and tutorials as well as access a selection of exclusive videos/tutorials made by craft influencers and professionals to draw attention to the Craft Exchange brand.  The Craft Exchange would be a peer 2 peer marketplace where users can sign up and create their “Craft Room”. From here they will be able to upload their own items they no longer use or need and also purchase second hand/pre loved items from other users “Craft Rooms”.  As a user of The Craft Exchange, you will be able to like listings, follow accounts, add ratings and reviews and chat with other accounts about items in their “Craft Room”. There would also be competitions and give always where you can win a number of the paid functions or supplies.   Phase 2 - With the upcoming success of The Craft Exchange, going forward with a phase 2, there will be 4 extra paid functions:  The Craft Exhibit – This would boost a user’s “craft room” and increase visibility within The Craft Exchange. It will be visible to more users based on their search/filters/craft. “Nudge” This boosts the visibility of single items and would appear in more users item feed/search results making it visible to the right users. Star Crafter and The Craft Exchange newsletter – This will give crafters the opportunity to promote their craft/and or business. This would appear on the main page of The Craft Exchange and on the newsletter Craft Business Ads – This would give crafters the opportunity to promote their craft business within peoples search engines.  Also as part of phase 2, The Craft Exchange would also include a member’s area which would have a small £2 per month subscription fee where users can join the community and access exclusive content, crafting forums and offers available to Craft Exchange members only. There will also be a newsletter which will be created on a monthly business.  The Future –   I have enjoyed thinking about the future of The Craft Exchange and I have a great list of ideas going forward so here are some ideas: The 5 year goal for The Craft Exchange would include a wide range of add on’s to the system including a bespoke Craft Exchange App as well as merchandise.  Franchise opportunities – The Craft Exchange sales  - selling craft supplies and items at one of The Craft Exchange sales  The employment of staff to support this amazing project and idea  Taking The Craft Exchange GLOBAL!  To promote the Craft Exchange, marketing will be done via various online and social media platforms which will include paid ads. Leaflets and door to door drops Stalls at craft fairs and shows, Word of mouth and craft influences.If you decide to back this amazing and pioneering project, your money will go towards, the build and design of the marketplace as well as marketing The Craft Exchange over various mediums, as listed above. It will also help pay for The Craft Exchanges first years insurance because I want its users to have trust in the business and feel secure using it.  If I am successful in raising the funds for this project, the plan going forward would be first and foremost to raise a social media presence. This will be done via crafting influencers in the UK, paid adds, words of mouth and contacting various crafting businesses asking for collaborations to promote foot traffic to The Craft Exchange on social media. Whilst doing this, I will be having a logo created for The Craft Exchange. Last but not least, I will start developing and designing the marketplace with the help of specialist designers ready to go live. The aim would be to get The Craft Exchange live within 6 months.  If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to drop me a message, I would be happy to discuss this great venture with you.",

                "Text": "In this day when it seems like so many are just resurrecting the past, we, at Artisan Electronic Instruments think art and technology have moved forward. And we want to bring something new into the world of synthesis.  NUCLEUS is a unique and powerful monophonic Synthesizer that combines the sound design of East and West Coast ideas, blends Analog and Digital technologies, and packs a vast sound palette into an intuitive user aesthetic.Don’t be fooled by its compact size. The NUCLEUS is anything but a classic remake or just a “more of the same” Synthesizer. There is a lot of sonic synthesis power hidden behind that 60hp panel, an extraordinary amount for such a small instrument.NUCLEUS fills any harmonic space with its complex 3 Oscillator block. Its analog and digital circuits churn out some serious walls of sound.  This little machine ROARS!Oscillator 1 is based on an analog discrete Saw-core circuit providing those classic Saw, Triangle, and variable pulse/PWM waveforms. Tied into it is a modulate-able 4 stage wavefolder for awesome metallic tones. The Sub-Oscillator has its own variable filter producing smooth pounding sine waves or all the way through a rich square.Oscillator 2 is also a fully discrete analog design with Saw, Variable Pulse/PWM, and PWM with Sub-Octave. But that’s just the start. It also has a selectable 2 or 3 stage Digital Ring Modulator. The DRM combines the waveforms of all three Oscillators for some amazing tones heard nowhere else. If that were not enough, Oscillator 2 can Hard-Sync to a separately controlled digital 4th oscillator.  Wait, there's more, when not in Hard Sync, it can be Frequency Modulated by Oscillator 3 through a dedicated VCA controlling the FM depth in real-time. Phew! I need to take a breath.Oscillator 3 is digital, why? To provide those unique sounds only found in the digital world. It still provides some clean anti-aliased standard shapes, like Sine and PWM but adds a few tricks, such as a variable slope Saw to Triangle wave, an adjustable width Swarm wave, and String tones using the Karplus-Strong physical model.  There are ten slots for custom waveforms and a noise source. Oscillator 3 also has a bit-crusher/sample reducer effect to get into some dirty digital color.And you can modulation just about anything! From pitch, wave-shape, and mix levels and the oscillator “special effects” of sub-shape, hard-sync frequency, FM depth, and bit crusher strength.There is so much to NUCLEUS before ever reaching the filter. But that bad boy does not want to be outdone. It is awesome in its own right. First off it offers a unique cascade multi-mode design. The filter runs in 2 pole Low Pass, Bandpass, and High Pass modes, as well as 4 pole versions of each. It’s the Dual-path Regeneration and 8-pole design that really give a unique character to the Bandpass modes, providing variable and modulate-able bandwidth and dual peak resonance. Since the filter can track over a wide range you can “play” these peaks and get a 5-oscillator sound or chord!\n  The filter has modulation inputs for cutoff, resonance, and filter shape. And after all that, the asymmetrical soft clipping circuits can bring in some much loved “dirt”. Just crank that Overdrive knob.With all this sonic power, the Artisan NUCLEUS Synthesizer controls it all with a deep and powerful modulation matrix. There are 50+ modulation sources and 30+ destinations that are all available simultaneously. An impressive amount for such a compact mono synth. There are 4 six-stage Envelope Generators (delay, attack, hold, decay, sustain, release), with looping, linear, and expo shapes and time and sustain modulation. 3 LFOs provide 9 waveshapes, key-sync, delay, and rate modulation. 2 external CVs and 4 modulation paths from the keyboard add more real-time modulation control. And now it gets wild. You can take those modulations sources and Add, Multiply, Average, Lag, Quantize, Switch, Sync knobs, contour, and route MIDI CC to create new modulation effects.  A modulation engine that has far more on offer than a classic mono synth.When you find that perfect sound, everything, all 200+ parameters per patch, can be stored and recalled instantly, from the front panel or by MIDI. Since we know you will love building your own sound library with the awesome NUCLEUS, there is enough space for 200 patches!Oh yeah, let’s not forget MIDI in and out with 2 assignable CV Outs and trigger.OK, that’s already too much reading. We have several demo videos on YouTube and will continue to add more as we go along.It's awesome to consider exceeding our goals...This mono synth is just the beginning. It is the building block, the “sound engine” for something bigger. With a successful campaign, the NUCLEUS family will be expanded to a 4-voice desktop and 6-8 voice flagship polysynth. And when these come out, you can trade in your mono desktop or Eurorack module for a discount on a poly… How? Because that powerful synth engine card in your Nucleus can be removed and inserted into the internal rack of voice cards that make up these new beasts. But we doubt you will want to part with your Nucleus once you have it integrated into your studio!But to make any of this a reality, we need your help bringing the NUCLEUS, and this new synth ecosphere, to life. We have a great couple of prototypes and most of the hardware, software, and mechanicals have been worked out. We have experience in low volume production with our previous Ottava synth, But to go to the next stage, we need volume.  We need volume to procure parts, PCBs, and mechanical components and reach any reasonable pricing and secure parts sourcing. We need to volume setup production runs and assembly. Artisan Electronic Instruments will always and wants to stay a boutique developer and producer, but the cost of building 1 or 10 units means so many of you would not be able to afford Nucleus, and we love it too much to keep it to just a select few!Many of you may already be following us on our Facebook page, Instagram, or YouTube channel. We will continue to post there and here, on this Kickstarter page, keeping you up to date each step of the way.",

I found myself quietly captivated by the diverse industrial worlds of portable sawmills, Kinkos, California craft fairs, and trade shows. I was drawn to digital creation tools such as Kid Pix, HyperStudio, PowerPoint, and Macromedia Flash early on. I found myself mystified with visual storytelling of early 3D video games such as Wolfenstein and Red Alert 2, carefully researching every issue of game magazines like GamePro as games evolved  into the massive modern marvels enjoyed today.I’ve noticed that all sorts of useful things are starting to feel outdated by the exponential evolution of touch-screen mobile devices, for business or even home application. The time has come for pocket computers to uplift the iconic timeless business tools that business people have always relied on while bringing technology into the current age. It’s a lot easier to understand the modern relevance of these essential tools when seen through the lens of the augmented reality app. That’s how I’ve come up with an idea of making one place where vast numbers of unique business cards can be crafted and experienced coming to life telling their owners' unique stories, and providing options to also present game-like 3D graphics. I chose 3 major mobile device business tools that are vital for any business, based on various business books, studies, and online articles.The rest is history - I researched thousands of educational programming sources looking for coding techniques, concise, and useful info! I have followed the trail to some really hard-to-find corners of the web that had only been engaged in single digits, and of course, used lots of popular online channels and communities where people share the information on a diverse range of coding topics.To ensure it’s easy to explore the collection of business cards, I consulted with over a hundred AR platforms and applications, and collaborated with a team of talented people who got inspired by the idea, and created AR Tool projects of various cool types of printed marketing materials in different styles.The AR & VR Viewer accumulated knowledge of many people of the past and present, and is energized by popular novels, 3D games and movies, resulting in the unique artefact beyond time and space.

                "Text": "Our fingerprints are always present on the screens when using our smartphones, no matter how clean we keep them. When we try to wipe them away, they get even more dirty and foggy. Our arms get tired when using our smartphones with our most comfortable poses. And we always had to zoom in and touch our smartphones when trying something new. Finally, I bet you had your fingers and wrists ache from using your smartphone too long.The smart controllers, currently sold in the market, are still helpful. But, they have to be used after a little break to use while driving or working out. Also, a mouse or a presentation remote is not very portable. Its clicking noises would get annoying in quiet places. LitZERO has solved all these inconveniences of smart controllers with just a touch of a button.LitZERO is a controller that can be used with all smart devices with a Bluetooth system installed. Get your job done by swiping and touching LitZERO, instead of your smartphone. The soft-touch and response time it's not going to let you down.You can move around like a mouse cursor and select, run, scroll front/back, etc. It would be just like using a laptop's touchpad.Put the Mouse Cursor on hold, and you can drag top/bottom, left/right, drag, select, scroll back/forward, etc. When you push the button on the left or move to your desired spot, touch the center, and hold for 3 seconds, you can put the pointer on hold. (When using on the mouse mode)We upgraded the select/run function and the scroll function to provide a smoother utilization of LitZERO. By doing so, it gives the users the exact same feeling of controlling with a mouse. Also, with the pointer holding mode, LitZERO was upgraded to handle tasks like scrolling through webcomics and pages with a single gesture.This mode is most adequate for users when listening to music while camping or trying to listen to music, or answer a phone call while driving or working out. Take control of your music with simple gestures while moving or working out. Just simply attach LitZERO to your car, bike, or backpack.LitZERO can also be used as a shutter for a camera, other than just enjoying a movie or some music.LitZERO would be phenomenal for those that enjoy watching Netflix or YouTube. Skipping back to the previous screen, fast forward, volume control, they are just the beginning of what LitZEROcan does. Now, enjoy your music/ movie while you are entirely laid back.While reading your books (webcomics, stories) digitally, flip through your pages hassle-free. You can flip through your pages with LitZERO sensing your gestures instead of you having to physically go up and touch your device's screen. Which wouldn't limit the users from watching online courses, Netflix, and YouTube.When presenting your PowerPoint during a lecture or a meeting, all you need is LitZERO. You can control your PowerPoint with simple gestures, without a bulky mouse or a pointer. It's because, LitZERO is programmed for Keynotes, PDFs, documents, memos, other apps, and etc.This mode is mapped with the directional key and a mouse. You can move and run the apps, visible on Android OS, and control videos. The Experiment mode will allow users to start mapping their keys via an app shortly.To sense the user's fingers, LitZEROis equipped with high-sensitivity static touchpads. These static touchpads can sense over 80 touches a second to instantly respond to user inputs. When a user inputs a touch pattern, a signal intaking algorithm allows LitZERO to output 12 different touch gestures or different coordinates.We went through countless challenges and tried to bring extremely sensitive and precise skills to life. And finally, it was able to be completed up to perfectionLitZERO's wireless Bluetooth connection can last up to 15M max. So even though the user might be distant from their smart device, its phenomenal connectivity allows you to take control. Not only  LitZERO can control your wireless earbuds' volumes, but it also enables users to leave their remote controllers behind when taking pictures.If your smart device is equipped with standard Bluetooth technology, all of your devices are good to go with this multi-controller. Allowing up to pair with 8 smart devices is an even more crucial gadget for smartphone lovers like you! (Bluetooth enabled devices with Android 5.0 & up, MacOS, IOS 13 & up, Window 10 & up)Smartphones are gadgets that we just can't live without. Well, the critical functions of smartphones and LitZERO are very closely connected. Users can answer a phone call by double touching LitZERO. If they are not in the right time to respond, they can swipe down on the touchpad.If you left your smartphone in your car, or if you dropped it and walked away from it then, LitZERO would ring its alarm. With LitZERO's anti-theft functions, keep your smart devices nearby without the fear of losing them. Now you might think, what if I lost LitZERO? Well, if you lost your LitZERO, you can look up where its signal was lost on the LitAPP!LitZERO is also designed with braille on its main body to allow the visually challenged to efficiently use the device. These were all made possible thanks to the constructive feedback we received from our visually impaired customers of our previous model. (Which they truly enjoyed listening to music and watching dramas). This design was applied in the hopes that every individual can enjoy using LitZERO. And it also functions as directional guidance for people without any disabilities.If LitZERO is running low on battery, then its red LED lights will flash. Or if it is fully charged then, the LED lights will turn blue. By upgrading LitZERO by installing USB C-Type plug-ins, it can fully charge within an hour and provides up to 3 days of use with a single charge. Also, if the users turn the On/Off only when they use the device, it can last up to 3 days. (Based on 100 touches an hour/ If the device is turned off, it would last up to 30 days.)For an even stabilized grip, LitZERO decreased its size and added the O-ring to use as a key ring for extra portability. Live and enjoy your life with the even smaller and portable LitZERO!1. Hold the button for more than 3 seconds. Then, a blue LED light will start blinking2.

And to use smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other smart devices was the sole purpose for the development of LitZERO. LitZERO can wirelessly control via Bluetooth, not like other regular controllers, and it can control apps by simply touching. It is designed like a key ring for more convenience and portability. Its Velcro allows users to attach LitZERO to backpacks or other clothing. We need our Backers' love and attention in our revolutionary leap.*We are currently all set to develop an even better product based on our backers' constructive love and feedback*Bluetium had been developing wearable smart wireless controllers since its incorporation back in 2017. Starting from 2019, we began B2C selling on our online stores. From 2020, we have started developing our own products and carried out various collaborations with different online cartoons and fashion brands and are broadening our product line-up. We hope to develop further and come up with even more awesome smart devices on the market. As the most trusted product launch company in the world, Enventys Partners has helped launch over 2,000 innovations with global sales of over $1 Billion dollars for our clients.By utilizing 20 years of experience in:Got an idea? We would love to help you launch it.This project is boosted by BackerCrew- This device is internally equipped with a battery so, it may cause injuries or product malfunctions from explosions.- Do not apply pressure or damage the product- Keep away dust, liquid, metal, or other debris from the bottom charging port.- If it starts to smoke or smell like it's burning, stop using immediately and contact customer service- Watch out for children or pets may bite or chew on them.-The adequate operating temperature is 0~35C.

                "Text": "There are many advantages to using Rony with a bike. First, the front LED is as powerful as a motorcycle headlamp. Second, the back LED creates a spot of light on the full area you are moving in. At night, while on the road, you will be completely visible to other vehicles.Rony is all about putting you in control, giving you six separate modes that start from the lowest setting of just 20 lumens to the highest at 1500 lumens. A simple touch switches you between the modes, making it easy and quick to adjust.Rony can be recharged with any power source; just use the USB cable in the kit. The charging starts automatically after connecting. Rony knows when the battery is fully charged and automatically stops charging to prevent battery overheating and overcharging.Totally ergonomic shape, small weight, and no useless details make Rony the most comfortable and enjoyable flashlight available. It doesn't take much space in your backpack, pocket, or purse.Branded flashlights are durable but high priced thanks to smart marketing. We offer the same quality with many more advantages and a reasonable price.It’s estimated that an astonishing 80% of all metal ever produced is still in use today. Due to the intrinsic value of metal, once made it is rarely wasted; and with good recovery systems in place, it’s possible to achieve recycling rates of 90%. The entire body is made from aluminum, which is infinite in usage. When the lifecycles of both plastic and aluminum are considered, it becomes clear that aluminum is by far, the most environmentally friendly option. Sometimes you don’t get to choose the environment you will be faced with and when things get wet, you will be glad that you have Rony with you. Rony is armored in premium aircraft-quality aluminum and there is no chance that moisture will penetrate inside and damage the inner components. Snow, rain, showers, or storms won’t take Rony out of service. Rony’s light will lead you through those dark and wet situations.It started with an idea—the idea of a hi-tech and modern flashlight. After countless discussions, we finally realized how the Rony flashlight should be designed and what functions it had to have. At this stage, our industrial designer started to make the first prototype design for Rony. The first model was very angular, hardly ergonomic, and looked ordinary, like most flashlights on the market. However, by trial and error, we finally integrated the design and made the flashlight more laconic, smooth shaped, stylish, and comfortable to carry. The final prototype was better than we could have imagined and now you can see it for yourself. What’s Inside?As for transparency, we follow the example of Elon Musk. İt is well-known that the Tesla company offers its findings in the open access.We also don't keep our prototype components a secret. To produce Rony, we use durable and premium quality materials. İt can be described as a technical construction with an eye-catchingl design. We hope that this way, you will feel part of the team and see the birth of a unique item with your own eyes.Our passion is creating the gadgets everyone will love. With the help of an amazing team of young and creative minds, we build unique gadgets for the community that appreciates innovations and exclusive design. By supporting our passion, you’re helping us as we approach our goal - release the best-designed flashlight. Plus, you get to enjoy the results of our development and innovation first. Thank you!1. Whether the bike mount is included in the scope of delivery. - Universal bike light holder is included in the basic Rony kit. It is suitable for all types of bikes as it has a universal attachment. 2. How water resistant is the Rony. Can I dive with it?- In our experience, no matter how many tests we have done, we have never been able to \"sink\" the Rony. At least the flashlight meets the basic requirements of IP67 waterproofing. Theoretically Rony should be able to withstand deep diving, but no such tests were conducted 3. Rony uses two LEDs, does this mean the battery life will be significantly lower than in a classic flashlight with one LED? - We use a sufficiently large 4200mAh battery which gives the torch a high power reserve. In addition the rear LED \"biom g4 5v\" has a very low power consumption. So overall the runtime of the torch is comparable to top manufacturers like Nitecore or Fenix.4. Can the battery be replaced with another battery? - Rony is a flashlight with a built-in battery. The flashlight can be disassembled into components if you wish, but we do not advise you to do so. Your battery will last a very long time, we use high quality Samsung batteries in the design.5. Why don't you use replacement batteries? - For your convenience. To charge a 18650 battery, you need a separate charger. Thanks to the battery built in the Rony is a battery charger in its own right. Therefore you only need a UCB-C cord and a power supply to power the flashlight. 6. Will my phone charge if I connect it with a Rony.- Yes, the flashlight has such a function. Its battery capacity is enough to recharge your phone and not to charge it several times in a row.7. How long does it take to fully charge the roni?- It takes approximately 3 hours to fully charge a fully discharged battery.8. Is there a warranty on the roni? - A full one-year warranty is provided on all components.                                                     The warranty does not cover breakage and physical damage to the lantern.9. Can I use Rony on my bike in the rain? Is it water resistant? The lantern is protected against splashing water and dust from any direction",

Once you do so on our interactive maps you will be able to see the people who are there, you’ll be able to view their pictures of said attraction, talk to them while they’re there, and some facts about the location. Want to explore the music scene? No problem, just attractions by music and get a list of local musicians, their history, pictures, work, and if you like them, when you’ll be able to see them playing around the town.Our goal is to bring a more interactive way to explore the world we live in. Unfortunately, most of us will never get to explore the planet to our content, however, with the help of this app we can see how these places are brought to life by the people living in them.

                "Text": "My family and I spent many vacations in campgrounds during hot summers and freezing winters.  We would often leave the RV to go site-seeing, and we would set our thermostat to an energy-saving temperature while we were away.  I always thought, \"how convenient would it be if I could control my thermostat remotely (like I can do with my home)?\"Given my 30 years of expertise in the HVAC industry, I was able to complete my own DIY project to remotely control the system in my camper, but I realized there wasn’t anything available for my fellow RVers to do the same.  Thus the idea of the RV Smart Thermostat was born!With the experience of my co-founder and collaborative team of software and hardware experts, we have spent the last 2 years and countless hours designing and innovating an All-In-One smart device for  RV owners around the world. Dan WalsdorfFounder and PresidentWalTech International, Inc.Please view the video on full screen to better understand the device featuresSince it's a smaller space, your rig can quickly get to extreme hot and cold temperatures which are highly unsafe for your pets.  This year alone hundreds of pets have been rescued and many pet owners have lost their loved ones.WalTech Smart RV Thermostat monitors the temperature & humidity inside your RV and quickly alerts you if it goes beyond the acceptable limit.  WalTech Smart RV Thermostat is both Wi-Fi and Sim card enabled. As an RVer, we understand how unreliable campground Wi-Fi can be.  Even when you are boondocking we want your thermostat to be connected to the cloud so that you can control it from anywhere in the world. We want you to have complete control.  So to help you understand better. We have 2 connectivity options that will enable WalTech thermostat to stay connected to the internet so that you can control your thermostat from anywhere in the world using your mobile app.Option 1: WalTech is Wi-Fi enabled. So if you have good Wi-Fi coverage inside your rig it connects to the Wi-Fi and stays online.What if I do not have reliable Wi-Fi inside my RV?\nOption 2: WalTech has a built-in sim card inside the device. So if you are not in a place where you have Wi-Fi coverage it uses the best available network around that area and helps the device to stay connected always to the internet.Is it connected to my personal sim card?\nNo, It is a separate global sim card that can connect to any available cell tower to help the device connect to the internet.What are my monthly charges?\nFirst, You can activate and deactivate the sim card using your mobile app. So you are only paying for the months that you use a sim card internet.\nFor the months that you use a sim card, there will be an extra charge of approximately $5 per month per sim card. Be it home or RV, HVAC systems contribute to more than 50% of energy usage.  You can save energy and money by analyzing and controlling your system while you are traveling and having fun. There’s nothing worse than coming back to your RV after enjoying a day out, only to find that someone has stolen all of your belongings.  Be it an RV park, storage facility, or your driveway these incidents are incredibly common. WalTech Smart RV Thermostat comes with a built-in PIR motion sensor so you don't have to pay extra for security systems.  It will alert you during any suspicious activity so that you can take immediate action to protect your investment.  WalTech Smart RV Thermostat can be connected to one cooling unit and two heating units.  If you have two ACs--one in your living room and one in your bedroom--you can install two separate thermostats and accurately measure humidity and temperature. You can connect both thermostats to the same mobile app and control the environment inside your RV from anywhere in the world.  Wiring details are mentioned below.Later, check out our two-pack thermostat pricing offers.Regular Smart Home Thermostats like Google Nest and Ecoobee works on 24V AC only. RVs operate on a 12V DC current so thermostats made for an RV should also work on 12V DC. There are a few old RV thermostats out there that work on a 7.5V DC current as well.WalTech is the only smart RV Thermostat in the industry with patent-pending technology that can operate from the lowest power input of  7.5 to the highest of 32V in both DC & AC.The comparison chart on voltage and other smart featuresThe biggest problem in crowdfunding after the prototype is manufacturing and bringing the product to the market as promised and What is your guarantee as a backer that you will get the value for your money?Team WalTech is 100% confident about the production and delivery to its backers. If we are not able to manufacture and bring the product to the market as promised, we will refund 100% money to our backer. We have spent countless hours researching and designing these features to make this thermostat truly an All-In-One device so that you don't have to spend money on multiple RV gadgets.  WalTech is the most Kickass investment for your RV.Shipping and fulfillment will be handled by Easyship Collect.  Due to the current volatility of shipping costs, shipping payments will be collected well after the end of the campaign, close to our ship date.  This will allow us to present the most accurate and up-to-date prices to pass savings on to you, our valued backers.  Currently, the approximate shipping charges within the USA are between $9 to $15 depending on your shipping preference.In that survey you will be able to:This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 2,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $900M raised between them.",

From even exploring where to go, how to get there, regional information, remote working tips for employees and employers, productivity hacks, local gym and event information we are set out to create the ultimate knowledge base for remote workers.\n Currently, the platform has this functionality:Navigating the trials and tribulations of traveling in remote locations among our community and connections of other seasoned remote workers, ZEAL’s founders have a breadth of experience and recommendations to make this process easier for our members. Members can navigate or search specifically for the information they want as well. A snapshot of some of the resources ZEAL will create include:At ZEAL we know that everyone’s desired experience and appetite for travel is unique. So, we are creating the go-to platform for all remote travel, work, and living. Our members can live their ideal lifestyle and personalize the timing, pace, and price tag to their liking.Within ZEAL there is a place for everyone. We are uniting all individuals, groups, organizations, associations, brands, destinations, and governments for a more seamless and connected travel experience.Our perspective is that collaboration by leveraging our connected strengths is far more effective than the competition. While each of the evolving communities, remote working hotels, and shared spaces have their benefits, target market, and experience, we know that each of those is just right for the right individual. Providing the hub to access and choose the ideal experience for each ensures that everyone benefits from this overarching community and infrastructure.Thus, we are taking a different approach here in how we compare ourselves to similar communities and programs. We leverage the strengths that each has while providing the community and platform to educate travelers.Simply, ZEAL is connecting like-minded people, brands, and destinations for an effortless remote living!Our experience building communities, communication, and engagement channels for local brands, municipalities, and global travel companies gives our members the ideal platform via an app to engage actively and often.  Within ZEAL we foster communities around like-minded interests, experiences, and regions so that our members can connect, support, and play online and off.At ZEAL, we are:While we typically are attracting 25- 55-year-olds that are seeking this flexible lifestyle we alternatively are seeing those that aren’t looking to work but to play and enjoy their life, test, and explore the world, and the next place or even places to stay for their retirement can be tricky. Troubleshooting multiple types of technology, social platforms, and apps to get the information and confidence needed to travel for retirees, ex-pats, and empty nesters can be daunting and often hinder them from making the trip at all.At ZEAL we are not solely uniting members, we are connecting and supporting them by bridging governments, media outlets, brands, and influential leaders. Partnering with governments and regional municipalities wanting exposure to remote workers to come to enjoy their destination, ZEAL is driving travelers for extended stays to bolster regional economies.ZEAL will be a global community connected to elevate remote living and working experiences. First, we have to start regionally and develop the community online as well as onsite. As we develop and grow the online community we will be launching our first location for ZEAL members to work together around the island of Barbados. From there, ZEAL will expand throughout the more prominent, in-demand, and tourist-friendly countries throughout Central America and the Caribbean. \n\n  Following the trends of where remote workers want to live and those that have the current infrastructure to effectively do so, we seek to expand throughout Europe and Southeast Asia thereafter. Initially focusing on the hospitality industry and supporting its return following the detrimental impact from COVID, we also see many benefits to fostering community through events, dinners, and music at the hotels. From there, we will expand to other villas, homes, condos, chalets, and bungalows around the world among other accommodations that allow them for extended stays.Equally, we see a large opportunity to enable remote working domestically. Many drive-to destinations have a variety of activities that a digital nomad could enjoy while having the flexibility to drive or fly somewhere else, even home to regroup, and live this adventurous lifestyle. From Moab to Jackson Hole, San Diego to Key West, people could spend a month or a season from coast to coast.Having experience supporting the hospitality and tourism industry from marketing to revenue management, tour operator experience to remote working programs, the Founders of ZEAL united through COVID to make remote working simpler and safer. The team at Social Capital Agency left their downtown office in Denver to work remotely in Tulum and support the leaders in travelers’ rebound. Working under lockdown, connecting virtually, and eager to push the boundaries of the industry to be more customer-centric, more valuable, more connected. They recognized the ability for the world to stay connected and productive outside the normal walls of their offices. Working virtually and leveraging technology for communication, we have seen organizations normalize remote working and the benefits are huge. Remote workers are more productive and happier than their counterparts and these are not the seasoned digital nomads that have years of experience.So, why were we not seeing more remote working? \n\n  Many people were still traveling, and the trends speak for themselves. Airbnb reported that 26% of their bookings for the first quarter of 2021 were for over 4 weeks at a time. We saw companies like Inspirato have limited inventory and be booked out for months. People were still actively paying for travel for extended periods. Yet, the adoption of remote working for a month or a year is not that common. Many have an interest in it but when asking any network of people, there are typically only one or two people that have worked abroad for any significant time.What is the missing link?Traveling for shorter periods is easy. People eat out almost every meal and bring enough clothes for their stay. For longer durations, the lifestyle and habits are very different as a traveler immerses themselves into local culture. The nuances and pitfalls are many and it takes a lot of courage to navigate these uncharted territories.To us, it seemed natural, effortless. With our experience and network within the industry, we saw a chance for everyone to benefit. Thus, the concept of ZEAL was born. With one simple question in mind, how do we share what this lifestyle is like to make it easier for others?We’ve found many have had the create it and they’ll come mentality. While traveling for less than two weeks maybe that way it takes showing people what the experience of remote working is like and what to expect. Collectively, we decided we had the knowledge, connections, and experience to normalize remote working anywhere that has a stable internet connection.As we pursue a traveling series around the world’s best remote working destinations, we decided we wanted to get our community involved and supporting us, provided feedback, and engaging to co-create the best and largest remote working community.Our seasoned team is composed of some of the industry’s best and most innovative businesses in their respective sectors. Covering expertise from marketing and tourism promotion to tour and hotel partnerships for discounts and community managers with a passion for giving back to the local community, we are eager and excited to elevate remote living for all. We are:Kathryn has been in the hospitality industry since she was 16. She has held various positions in banquets, restaurants and hotels, and resorts. You could easily say that hospitality is in her blood. She believes the world is a big place and enjoys exploring all types of new places as well as revisiting her favorites. Traveling by plane, boat, train, or car she loves it all! So far, Kathryn has traveled to just under 70 countries. Meeting with people from different cultures and sampling different cuisines rate at the top of her must-do’s while traveling. She is obsessed with travel planning and is known amongst her friends for always finding the very best things to do in every area. With a bucket list that grows every day, she is trying to reach 100 countries in the next few years. She has been working remotely for twenty years and loves the flexibility it provides and the opportunities to travel.\n Trevor learned that hospitality was his passion when he was 16, working at a restaurant in the Canadian Rockies. He then moved into the cruise industry, where he traveled all around the world with the sole purpose of ensuring that all his guests were cared for and having the time of their lives. He later went to work for hotels and resorts and learned and loved it just as much. When not working, Trevor loves to travel. He is a pilot and can often be found landing at new and exciting destinations. His father planted the travel seed early on, leading by example his dad has traveled to over 130 countries! Trevor has traveled to just over half as much as his Dad and is eager to beat the family record. Trevor has been working remotely for fifteen years and is often seen combining business and pleasure during his travels.Eric and Devon founded Social Capital Agency was founded with the concept of quality of work-life balance, even integration was important. That’s why our motto is 2 Parts Fun and 1 Part Business and we believe that people can be even more productive, healthy, happy, connected, and inspired when they are passionate about the impact they are leaving. With our passion being to empower people to travel and experience the world more easily we work with hotels and destinations to support local tourism economies. As Covid hit and we retreated to Tulum for a month to work remotely we recognized how tough it can be for most to navigate traveling for extended periods and balancing working remotely. \n\n  We saw an opportunity to share our knowledge, insights, connections, and partners to make remote working more accessible. Supporting hotels and local communities by connecting people and experiences in a seamless way that benefits all may be what our agency does but we are all avid travelers and love connecting with people ourselves. From backcountry snowboarding to scuba diving, climbing and wakeboarding we love supporting the brands that fuel our passion while bringing together communities to support them.\n Travis and Jason are avid travelers with a passion for remote work and community building. They met as early employees at Remote Year, a venture-backed travel startup redefining how remote workers live and travel.\n During their time at Remote Year, they worked together to build and manage 60+ communities of remote workers, owned internal and external initiatives to build remote culture and planned and executed a series of offsite events. Most importantly, they met thousands of remote workers and learned what made for successful remote companies.Bringing a combined 10+ years of remote work experience along with their record of accomplishment of assisting 1,000's of individuals in their transition to remote work, they decided to create Sprawl Consulting to help usher in the new generation of remote-friendly companies, full of long-term, happy and productive employees.",

The Sportneer TrainNTrack Ankle Weights fulfill the gap of the beginner-friendly smart fitness market and break the high barrier of entry by offering the most accessible and cost-effective equipment and tutorials for amateurs and beginner athletes.The Sportneer App has 8 different training lessons and offers over 71 exercises.

To be more specific, it combines the 3 Cartesian coordinate axis accelerometers with a sensor that takes gyroscopic measurements along these 3 axes: pitch, roll, and yaw.

                "Text": "The Samurai has been something we have been dreaming before we knew what that would be. Windsurfing has been our summer hobby which we did every day! We rarely missed a sunrise without the cool wind in our hair and the sea in our grasp while we glided through the waves. We thought to ourselves; is there something more to it? Then we started experimenting and researching different ways to make the simple surfboard, something which would revolutionize the industry but as always having in mind the reason we try to tame the waves, have fun!We at Jet Prod. Want to create a jet-powered wakeboard which doesn't require wind, is easier to control but harder to master. Creating and designing it isn't an easy task, considering the amount of jet-powered wakeboards out there in the market who have a lot more than 2 people making their dreams come true. Our primary focus is the price, speed of the wakeboard and the weight it can carry. Due to the demand of the wakeboards by the surfing community, our designer and engineer is being extremely cautious in to what kind of materials we will use and the cost of said materials. The Samurai will be efficient, capable of *by approximation* no more than 120kgs/264lbs and keep its retail price lower than the industry average.Features of the productThe Samurai board will be equipped with:● A carbon fiber impeller● Electronic flaps which will be controlled by the rider on hand and deploy the e-brake (will go into more detail below)● Hydrodynamically shaped slim wakeboard for optimum maneuvers (will go into more detail below)● Maximum Velocity 35 knots (64km/h) 200kgs (440lbs) of force● Jet drive diameter 90mmJet prod offers a cozy environment and conducive atmosphere for a great business. We set and maintain the highest standard of quality and ethics in everything we do. We will provide perfect, excellent, and reliable services to our customers. We will work hard in order to earn the trust of our customers, employees, partners, and our community and keep developing our products with the utmost attention to detail. Under the cooperation of a determined and united team of management staff; we are expertly led by an open-minded individual whose dedication to helping others achieve their goals in this extremely important passion.With many years working hands-on with the technology and components used, at Jet Prod, even with the constant and consistent change in the jet-powered wakeboard sphere, we ascertain that our customers will be provided with best tools to have the fun they are promised when trusting our product. Providing our products at a reasonable price, way lower than our high end competitors, is our paramount goal.A key factor of business we shall not handle with levity is customer satisfaction. We will ensure the highest quality of services at all time to meet or surpass our customer's expectation. We will ensure that every customer’s needs and requests are duly and properly noted to offer our services to the high standard they should receive. All our services will be customer-tailored and specifically designed to meet & exceed expectations. Up-to-the-minute and workable jet-powered wakeboard production plan will be laid down as elementary as possible for customers to easily comprehend and implement for the company’s success and growth.Paramount marketing strategies proven to boost business publicity and awareness will be carried out to ensure the necessary awareness and advertisement is achieved for our company both locally and nationally. Social media platforms will be fully utilized; such as Instagram & Facebook as well as the word of mouth which is a powerful marketing strategy even in times like these.Mission StatementThe electric waterjet industry is filled with various types in many different price points. The wakeboard which we will supply to our customers may not have the same appeal to enthusiasts as already established wakeboard companies have the market cornered. By utilizing the technological knowledge we possess, we will create a product which will have a price depicted by today’s economy but at the same time be of the highest quality. Since, 3D printing has been made available to everyday users, Jet Prod will invest in this revolutionary method in order to create the small items needed to operate the wakeboard Samurai.We will create the mold for manufacturing the wakeboard and create the water jet by using the 3D printer therefore the cost will be as low as we can possibly so can everybody have access to this experience. The water jets have been made with great success and one of the wake board’s features is the E-brake. Since, not everyone is a professional rider, we will create a mechanism which halts the board the moment the rider loses his balance and falls into the water, the board will be up to 5 meters away from the rider. In addition, the E-brake methodology includes a flap creating a camber line larger than the jet surf axis, increasing the lift factor on the back edge of the surf to minimize the time it takes surfs to start planing in the water.The wakeboard itself has been designed to be thin and weigh less than 10kgs and the battery less than 15kgs. The weight is the most competitive aspect in retrospect to other wakeboards in the industry. The electric motor which will be used will be 22kw and will produce 12Nm of torque at 6000rpm. The power of the water jet in static mode (This is the mode when the wakeboard is fully stopped, when it’s speeding the power is increasing above the numbers mentioned above) and the water jet’s motor thrusting force will be almost 200kgs.This has been made possible due to the exceptional design of the water jet.Lastly, this product will be competitive in the market for these three reasons below,In the following video we present some footage of testing the first prototype electric surfboard. Everything its our design and creation except electric motor, battery pack and wireless controller.Target MarketOur company aims to grow in the thriving market of water sports. The water sports market has a steady upward trend and analysts predict that it will keep its upward trend until 2025. The most popular water sports consist of windsurfing, kite surfing and puddle surfing between ages 15 to 50 years old. The puddle surfing's popularity increased due to the global pandemic which came into effect by the shopping boom worldwide. Although, the past year it is slowly began to not be as trending as the early pandemic days. We aim in making the motorized surfing the leading water sports industry. By creating innovative and new surfboard models but also low prices, we are directly competing with the companies which have a large customer list. The demand for this specific water sport is not that great, due to not being as popular as other ones, which we at JetProd have a big inclination to change that. Creating advertising campaigns which main purpose will be to make the customer keen to try this new mode of entertainment, to accomplish that we will sell the board as a mode of \"renting\" on touristic attracted areas and make in known both in Greece and other countries.Sales forecastAccording to our research, in the first year the sales will be only from professional water sports rentals in many well-known beaches in Greece. We estimate that in the first year we will have 240 orders at the price of 6.5k€. In the third year we will present a second model SAMURAI II, to increase the number of sales, and recognition by the public. The second model will be sold with a price increase of 9.5k€. SAMURAI II will be high – end board with key features of the automotive industry. At last, the third model will reveal at the end of the fourth year and will be named Aris Pro. Aris Pro will be the first model in the world, with self-charger. With our experience we will include a photo voltaic system on the board, where will powered up the board. Aris Pro price will begin from 10.5k€. In the fifth year the old models’ price will be discounted.Cash FlowObserved below is the IRR of five years being operational is 20% and also 29% exponential increasing profit over the five year plan is the Compound Annual Growth Rate. Lastly, we analyzed the risk of having a drop in sales of 30% from year one up to year five the IRR index is still at 10% in the specific five-year span.Management Team & OrganizationA clear mission gives purpose and direction to every team, in order to reach its goals and overcome every barrier and obstacle. JetProd’s team has a clear mission, to produce an innovative solution and an immense service in the field of water sports fun.

She is very analytical and has the necessary marketing skills. She is going to be the CMO of JetProd.This is our team... so far.TimelineThe following two months will strongly focus on making a friendly workstation for employees and start to design a perfect board. Our target is as long as we design and manufacture the board, we will check it instantly for functionality and about safeties for the rider. At the end of the third month, we will have a tested prototype board where we will start to manufacture this in mass production, and by the time we will start to advertising in social media and in some places with touristic population.With the functional design already laid out, all there is left to do is build the prototype to test and double check to see if any last-minute items should be added or changed. Your investments in the Samurai will make that possible and bring this project to life!Creating new designs of hardware and technology can be expensive the first time around, and generate high initial costs for things like tooling, prototyping, sourcing of material and labor costs.That is where your contributions take action. Your pledge will be used towards creating the JetProd prototype, for research and development, and eliminating those obstacles of upfront fees.Once the prototype is created, the tests will involve various  tests that will be documented before the official release date.Once the Samurai has been tested, tried and proven, the goal is to have it available for ordering online from our website as a final product for all to enjoy on all coasts of the world.Our overall goal is to source all materials completely from Greece, which will give opportunities to small local shops. Your contribution will help with that as well.Your pledge will also give us a chance to effectively advertise through social media, businesses, online, and through our local beach stores right here in Athens!Not only will your contributions help bring the best out of ourselves but you will also give this project and my small business the chance to be seen and heard by others who love to build and create.",

As soon as I started, I realized that many concepts were difficult to understand. The reason is that I grew up in a Spanish-speaking Caribbean country. Many of the terms were difficult for me despite having lived in the United States for almost twelve years and speaking fluent English. I immediately thought the solution is to start looking for documentation in Spanish. I spent almost a week researching different articles and sources from Universities, however, the more I read, the more confusing it became for me. I realized that I understood less in Spanish than in English. The reason is that many immigrants learn to think in English and forget some words and concepts in Spanish. Another reason is that we are mostly exposed to English in everyday activities, such as listening to music, watching TV, spending time with friends, etc. Then I began to learn these terms in Spanish and English and I realized that my brain absorbed the contents faster. Unfortunately, in this school year I have been able to observe many of my classmate's struggle with the same problems, many, although they are very intelligent and disciplined, do not manage to do well in classes due to the language barrier.That is why I would like to open a YouTube channel, a website, and a podcast where I can do tutorials, and write blogs where I help Spanish-speaking students to better understand classes such as Mathematics, Computer Science, Philosophy, etc.",

                "Title": "SODAQ AIR - The Portable Air Quality Monitor",
                "Text": "Air quality has continued to decline over the last decade.  As a result,  you probably already know some facts about air quality like... It tends to be worse in the city than in the country,  a lot of the air pollution we experience are emissions from things like cars and factories, and that an increasing number of diseases and deaths are being traced back to air pollution. The curious thing about the problem is that a lot of people don't know what in the air is causing this. So it begs the question, do you know what is in your air?Chances are information about air pollution specific to your location isn't exactly easy to access. That's because air is primarily measured, through big, static air quality monitors (AQM). And while those AQM’s are great for providing city-wide averages, they really aren't telling you all too much about the air you are moving through.You had access to your own portable air quality sensor,  that gave you real-time, air quality readings?That question was the foundation on which the AIR was built.The SODAQ AIR, allows you to understand what you're coming in contact with on a daily basis. By collecting data wherever you go, you'll be able to monitor personal exposure to air pollution, avoid those heavily polluted areas, and choose the healthiest routes.You'll also be contributing to a worldwide collection of data points that will be instrumental for governments and organizations in understanding air quality trends and building solutions for them.In 2015, we created the first version of the AIR and with it reimagined how air quality was collected.  The idea was to give everyone the “keys'' to understanding their air because we figured that the best way to work on air quality for the people, was with the people.  All of the collected AIR quality data was freely accessible to governments and other organizations aiming to build solutions to improve the quality of the air.In 2017,  as part of a collaboration with the Dutch Province of Utrecht and company Civity, the AIR became part of the Sniffer Bike project. When the project came to completion in January 2021, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and Environment (RIVM) validated the air quality data collected by the Sniffer Bikes. With the official green light from the RIVM, the AIR's and their data were considered to be valuable additions to the existing network of fixed air monitoring stations. Now 7 years, 2 prototypes, thousands of cycled kilometers, and 20 million air quality measurements later - we are back with the new and improved SODAQ AIR.We made sure the AIR is ready to go, as soon as you are!The air on your trip- Each trip you take tells a unique story about the air quality.  Whether it's in the morning or the evening, the sun or the rain all affect the air quality. The AIR keeps track of it all and monitors the PM levels, temperature, and the exact location at which the readings were taken. You can access all of your journey data by inputting your AIR's unique identifier into the map.Know Your AIR Map- The aggregation of all the data in a 100x100 meter area, is averaged on an hourly basis and added to the global map as open data. This creates a network of detailed air measurements across the globe while making sure that you, your journey, and your data contribution all remain completely anonymous.Can our data tell us more?Our collective data will create an intricate, and complex network of air quality measurements that spans as far as you can cycle.  It will provide you with day-to-day insights allowing you to avoid areas with high PM levels and minimize exposure.When enough of us become part of the community, our data can tell us about so much more than just the air.  For instance, it can show temperature patterns in cities, allowing heat islands to be detected and potentially indicating areas that cause heat stress. The limiting factor becomes what the governments and organizations using the data can imagine. Working on the AIR We Breathe - Together!The AIR is a highly intuitive device, which tells you everything you do and don't want to know about the air you breathe.The AIR is fitted with several sensors which will give you an accurate picture of the air you’re moving through.PM sensor - Measures the particulate matter (PM) floating around in the air. Its primary focus is picking up PM 2.5, but it also monitors PM1.0 & 10.Temperature sensor - Was it hot or cold? We need to know! The temperature has a tremendous influence on the behavior of air, making temperature insights incredibly useful when trying to discern patterns in PM concentrations.Humidity sensor - Like temperature, the amount of water in the air also plays a large role in PM levels and how it behaves.GPS Antenna - Keeps track of the exact location at which data points are collected.Accelerometer - Monitors motion of the device, signaling the device when it needs to turn on and off.Designed to give you a quick rundown of the quality of the air as you're cycling, the LED strip positioned on top of the AIR shines in one of 3 colors.Green - The levels of PM in the air are low. So that breeze you feel flowing through your hair is a-okay! Yellow - There is a moderate amount of PM floating around in the air. No need to worry but you might want to tie up your hair.Red - The levels of PM floating around in the air are quite high. Even without the sensor, you'll probably be able to tell you don't want this breeze in your hair.The AIR comes with a simple turn-lock mount that allows you to quickly attach it to the handlebars of your bicycle or any other non-motor vehicle or object.When you're on the move all you need to do is mount the AIR and go. But if you want to know about the air quality in one place over an extended period of time, the AIR can also be used as a static monitoring device!0 to 100 in 2 hours - The AIR is powered by a supercapacitor, our alternative to regular batteries. It'll take 2 hours to charge from 0-100%, and then gives you 8 hours of functionality.Capacity stays at 100 - The supercapacitor doesn’t decay over time, which means the AIR will keep giving you those 8 hours until the end of time. The AIR is designed to use its energy as efficiently as possible, and for that reason, it communicates over LTE-M & NB-IoT networks. As these networks are fairly new technologies, they aren't yet accessible everywhere in the world.LTE-M & NB-IoT networks will be coming to everyone in the near future, rest assured that this is not a matter of if, but of when!Color of the AIR Over the last few months, we have been rigorously testing the white prototype model of the AIR which you've seen through our Kickstarter. The model which will go to production will be identical to the one to the prototype, except that it will be in the blue you see below. DimensionsMade to follow you wherever you go, because keeping tabs on the air shouldn't be hard. The AIR is small enough to fit into the palm of your hand, making it easy to pack away when you’re not cycling.Air is free and so it seems only fitting that access to the information on air is too!The Hardware  -  we’ve shared the complete blueprints of the device using a CC license. That means everyone, everywhere, has access to the information to build and repair their own AIR (either as we designed it, or with their own adjustments), and will be able to share their data into the AIR map.Open-source data: Through the CC license the data is just as accessible as the hardware.  Any individual, university, or non-profit organization can utilize the anonymized data, download it to CSV or access it via our API, entirely free of charge.For commercial usage - refer to the FAQ section We see a world without batteries.SODAQ stands for Solar Powered Data Acquisition and was founded by father and son Jan Willem & Ollie Smeenk back in 2013, while creating solar-powered weather stations for farmers in rural Africa. By harvesting energy from the environment, and working as efficiently as possible with the energy they had at their disposal, the weather stations set the foundation for all subsequent SODAQ products. With our solutions, we aspire to create a better world, for people but also for the environment. This community project came to be because at SODAQ we believe that when it comes to global challenges like air pollution, the collective strength of the people will be the determining factor to creating a better world.  Together, we can use IoT as a force for change. ",

We will start from the absolute basics, and we will walk together through the process of understanding the basics of swift programming in general before we dive into app development with SwiftUI. We will build 4 fully functioning apps as part of this course, and if we reach our stretch goals, we will build even more.Things that you will learnBasics of ProgrammingApp Development\n         1) RockPaperScissors - A game against your phone \n         2) Quizzer - A quiz app that lets you study or have a game of trivia with your friends. \n         3) InvestmentCalculator-Calculate predicted compound interest growth and view current stock and currency values.  \n         4) Contect - The Contact Manager for making connectionsThings that you will receive as part of the courseWhen I was about 14, my dad began trying to persuade me to learn to write iPhone apps. There was an obvious need for young people that knew how to code. I got really excited about the idea, but I didn’t connect with a way to start the learning process, and so the idea fizzled, and several years passed. When I was 21, I was again introduced to the idea of learning app making. I jumped on the opportunity, and I have spent the last two years working on various apps every day.I started learning to program in Swift, and while studying Physics and Computer Science in university, I was exposed to several other languages including C++, Python, Wolfram, Matlab, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I have spent hundreds of hours writing thousands of lines of code. I have written dozens of IOS applications with varying degrees of complexity, and I am working on bringing my first app to the app store within the next year.I have more recently fallen in love with SwiftUI, Apple’s sleek, declarative language for building native applications. Building apps has never been simpler. I look forward to helping you to learn how to use this powerful tool to bring your development to the next level.$1,000$2,500$5,000$7,500$10,000Firstly, I have been in your shoes. I have recently been in your shoes, learning how to program, and I have learned from searching through hours of other online sources to learn the things that I have learned. I was often frustrated with tutorials and classes that assumed that I had a lot of background knowledge that I did not have. I felt lost for much of my early experience coding. I want to be able to pass on to you the experience that I have gained from hundreds of hours of learning this material.  I am excited to make your journey into Swift programming as smooth as possible.Secondly, although I have not been involved in tutoring for Computer Science before, I do have experience tutoring in other technical subjects: primarily Physics. I believe firmly in teaching for understanding, and I will do my best to help you understand not just what the code is doing, but also why the code behaves as it does. I care deeply that you understand the material in this course. You will learn by following along line by line, building the sample applications for yourself, and having opportunities to be creative on your own. ",

I tried everything from hats to sunbeds with canopies and carefully positioned trees or buildings...I kept saying to myself: 'I just want something to block the sun from my head, that is simple, inexpensive and easy to adjust as the sun moves'So I mashed together a bracket and a cardboard disc which kind of did the job - but when using my mobile or Kindle, thought: 'What if I could attach my device to the back of the disc?' That's when the SOMBRILL was conceived.Three months of samples, testing and discussing the design and we now have the finished, high-quality prototype, poised for production in a reputable Chinese factory. SOMBRILL is robust, flexible, attractive and versatile. It can be fixed to almost any sunbed, table or armrest and can hold any device up to a small tablet. It protects your face from the harmful sun, while allowing you hands-free viewing of your screen.We just need the funding for the first order of 1000 units - and by this time next year, Rodney...

                "Text": "Why do 1 in 5 kids have a mental health disorder?\nWhy is suicide the second leading cause of death for people aged 15-29?\nWhy do 86% of teens with mental health disorders not tell anyone?I was 17 when I was first diagnosed with OCD. It got so bad to the point that I wasn't even able to look at my own face in the mirror. I felt alone, isolated, and scared, and I decided to make sure that nobody else had to go through what I did. This is why I started Uhane.Uhane is many things. We are a startup. We are a non-profit. We are a community. We are here to help. Uhane provides resources, apps, and a community to help address the mental health issue in teens.One of the main features of Uhane upon launch was its community forum. This was created to give teens a space to share their struggles and experiences with a supportive community of peers that could provide advice, encouragement, and comfort in tough times. Uhane's community is divided into several categories, each corresponding to an important aspect of mental health so that users can get the information most relevant to them.Another key output of Uhane is its apps. Uhane's first app was VENT, which allowed teens going through a crisis to anonymously connect with another user and let out their feelings without fear of exposure or backlash. We also intend to launch another app called Diversion Games. These are intended for when people find themselves overwhelmed by their emotions and are unable to manage them. This collection of simple, engaging, and entertaining games will allow people to divert from their overpowering emotions into a healthier state.Uhane's first published book is called Serenity: A Beginner's Guide to OCD. This is a collection of anecdotes related to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder detailing a journey of growth and acceptance through a mental and emotional crucible. The intention of this book is to help clear up misunderstandings surrounding mental health and this disorder, to raise awareness of this issue in teens, and to encourage teens struggling with something similar to seek professional help and to remind them that they are not alone. This book is set to launch in March 2022.When talking to parents about mental health, we realized that many don't understand how to discuss such issues with their children. We decided to create Conversation Cards that show conversation starters, important questions to ask, good practices, topics to avoid, and disorder-specific information to encourage and facilitate healthy and informative conversations between parents and teens. The conversation cards are set to launch in January 2022.We understand that a lot of people don't want to read. A lot of articles on mental health are long and tedious, and while we have done our best to keep ours short and sweet, we recognize that we can explore such concepts through other media as well. Our podcast aims to reiterate critical information surrounding mental health issues as well as provide listeners with additional insight into relevant concepts.Building on what we learned from the podcast, we are also planning on launching a monthly comic for Uhane that depicts the struggles of someone going through a mental health condition. The purpose of this is to create a set of relatable characters with whom readers can identify and use them to inspire growth and recovery. This would also help parents understand more clearly what their child is going through.Wait, I thought this was a non-profit? Well, yes, it is indeed. All proceeds from our store go straight to raising awareness for mental health through the production of content and resources under Uhane.1. We need help with publishing Serenity and getting it out as far and wide as possible so that we can raise awareness and help as many people as we can2. We need to develop 3 Diversion Games scientifically proven to calm the mind3. We want to develop 2 apps to help teens feel better about themselves and get help quickly4. We need to design and develop our Conversation Cards and get them into production to get them in the hands of as many parents as possible5. We want to translate Uhane into 7 different languages to make it accessible around the world6. We need to publish the first run of our Uhane comic7. We need to produce the first run of Uhane merchandise We hope that you believe in this cause just as we do, and we look forward to making a difference.Thanks :)",

                "Text": "Thousands of people died on roads all over the world. Someone was riding a bicycle, someone was going along a road, someone had gotten out of a car. Everyone of these poor people could be rescued. They just had to be more visible on the road. Drivers of cars were not able to see them in the dark. Even the brightest clothes are visible in the semi-darkness of the road only when the distance is really short.  Braking distance of many cars is more than the driver's vision capabilities.Development of modern technologies lets us change the problem cardinally. Until nowadays, every vest, which is recommended for being visible at the road, is based on the principle of a reflecting light, which is a low-performance solution. Our solution was spied from nature. A miracle, which is created by evolution, is fireflies. They have an ultra-small size of their bodies, but they are visible even in a dark deep forest. These small, but smart creatures are able to attract attention everywhere. As soon as fireflies have appeared at a field, everyone knows it. Firefly is sort of a progressive lighthouse of evolution.Our Vest is made of special fabric, which is developed specially for bright illumination in the darkness. Thousands of light-conducting fibers transmit the LEDs’ light, therefore the whole vest turns into one big firefly, into a big flashlight, which is impossible not to notice either it’s dark or just cloudy weather. And if several people, who are standing together, will wear the vest, they turn into one big bright spot of light, which is visible at the distance of several hundreds meters in all weather.The development of these vests is a breakthrough in the sphere of road security.  Vest “Fireflies” works perfectly in any weather, in any temperature. Everything is easy: Dress it up and turn it on and you will be wondered how bright you are and how much attention you have attracted!Built-in pocket small high-power batteries could be charged as easily as your phone, just connect the charger to USB. The vest is assembled reliably. It lets you take  long extreme bicycle trips or other types of trips. Our vest “Fireflies” is also useful for  children, who will not get lost in a forest. A bicycle trip with children also becomes safe.The production of vests of new generation is our family business.  Making income is not our first purpose. The biggest award for us would be hundreds of children and bicyclists, who will be lighting up their road in the darkness of the evening like lighthouses. Our mission is creating a safe environment for everyone, who needs to be more visible in the park , in a country, on the road. My children like to ride a bike, scooter, skateboard and they will do it only with vest “fireflies”. Another direction is electric scooters, they have a small size and high speed unlike bicycles. they are less visible therefore riding an electric scooter without the lightning vest is madness. Let the advances of technology protect the safety of your rest.Your donations are necessary for the acceleration of engineering for the benefits of all humanity. We will purchase a special fabric, make devices for cutting and creating a luminous cloth. We will assemble, pack and ship the finished product. We will create a quality control structure at all stages of our production.\n Our inventions and developments will not leave you unnoticed.The first vest that produces light.All other vests are designed on the principle of “returning” of reflected light, our vest is the source of light. It’s designed specially for bicyclists and people, who are on the road at night. The vest is made of luminous fabric. The fabric is made from a variety of intertwined glass fibers, through which low-voltage current flows from the battery, which lies in the inner pocket. The cloth of fabric replaces hundreds of small LEDs connected in one continuous carpet of fire. The battery is securely attached in the pocket. The microswitch allows you to instantly turn on the bright light source. The vest is perfectly visible from a few hundred meters away. The built-in battery will surely last for 6-8 hours of walking. It is possible to increase the working time. To do this, you just need to put another battery. The batteries are charged via the USB connector. The vest is not afraid of moisture, precipitation. It works confidently in a large temperature range. A huge time resource of glowing elements. Three sizes are available for ordering: S, M, XL; adjustment straps are provided on the side.Take care of the safety of yourself and your loved ones. In the vest \"fireflies\" you will become more noticeable, you are perfectly visible, even in the worst weather. \"fireflies\" - a lighthouse in the sea of madness of darkness. The vest is reliably protected and is not subject to shaking and vibration during long walks on a bicycle, scooter, moped. A great innovative replacement for the well-served, but still rapidly losing its position, classic, good old reflective vest.\n Modern technologies will take under their wing the protection of your security.The new reality requires new solutions.Our site in the web: http://firefliesvest.tilda.ws/eng",

                "Text": "With ever-improving technology, mobile photography is quickly catching up. We believe that the future of photography is in your pocket. The best camera is the one you have with you, and that camera is your phone. YeeChan has created a Depth of Field（DOF） lens specifically designed for Smartphone: the 50 mm  F/1.7  Capture vibrant image quality, superb bokeh, shallow depth-of-field and film-style look and the ability to pull focus manually like on professional cinema cameras. The F/1.7 aperture lets more light into the lens, which could effectively reduce the ISO sensitivity and obtain a low-noise transparent to improve your image quality. The circular aperture formed by 11 aperture blades  bring a large foreground and background blur, make the subject more prominent, and can bring a soft picture effect. So you can comfortably shoot in low-light, complex environment or night conditions.Achieve the perfect portrait with the 50 mm  F/1.7 provided by YeeChan lens, highlighting your subject's features with shallow depth of field to create an intimate visual perspective. The 50 mm focal length has a field of view close to what the human eye sees, and can be used for composition shooting with a more familiar visual experience. Although imaging does not have the distinctive personality of wide-angle or telephoto lenses, as long as you actively adjust the distance to the subject to change the composition, you can also get refreshing effects. It is precisely because of this that the 50 mm focal length can be adapted to shooting in a wide range of fields such as portraits, street photography, scenery, pets, and food.YeeChan uses a durable alloy bayonet and the matte metal silver design is used on manual aperture  the with the camera, it looks magnificent and has a high degree of recognition.The optical structure of the YeeChan is 11 elements in 11 groups. YeeChan also uses multi-layer coating with good anti-reflection effect, which can increase the transmittance of the lens, effectively suppress the glare and ghost caused by the light source in the picture, and reduce the influence of backlight on imaging. Brings a clear and transparent photo effect.The Minimum Focusing Distance of the lens has been shortened to about 0.15-0.2 meters. You can get closer to the subject during shooting, and take small objects larger to achieve a macro-like effect. Coupled with the natural perspective of the 50 mm standard lens, it can provide an effect close to the human visual experience, which is very suitable for shooting food, snacks, small objects and commodities.Because it is designed to be your most frequently used lens, we made it compact. Now you can enjoy advanced optical performance in a compact size  with a total length of only about 119 mm （4.7in）and a weight of only about  360g. It is good to take it with you when you go out, or hold it for a long time, which contributes to the stability of shooting. Making it easier to use.YeeChan allowing videographers to make smooth aperture changes while retaining traditional aperture stop for stills photographers. The manual focus ring is incredibly smooth and perfectly damped, allowing for smooth and accurate focus results across the 180 degrees of focus travel.In order to solve the mechanical challenge of the precise bayonet interface with the space constraints around the iPhone camera. YeeChan employs a threaded connection for a firm, easy to use the connection.The Moisture-Resistant and dust-proof structure is adopted, and the bayonet, focus ring, switch panel and switch of the lens are sealed to improve the reliability of the lens. In addition, by improving the strength of the lens barrel and redesigning the structure of the part connection, a highly robust lens body structure is realized without increasing the weight as much as possible.YeeChan compatible with iPhone X and above and Samsung Galaxy S10/S10+ /S20/ S20+.The YeeChan lens projects the image upside down. For this reason, we recommend using a third-party app to flip the image back to the normal orientation, such as FiLMiC Pro (Video - iOS and Android), ProCamera (Photo and Video - iOS), Filmakr (Video - iOS), MAVIS (Video - iOS), ProMovie (Video - iOS), Camera 645 Pro Mk 3 (Photo and Video - iOS) or Open Camera (Photo/Video - Android). You can also use the YeeChan in your smartphone’s stock/native camera app with the image flipped upside down if you prefer.",

                "Text": "Running is a workout that uses all of the major muscles of our body and develops our physical and mental fitness. People have always believed that going on long, intense runs would upgrade their physical abilities. But, intense/ exhausting workouts only tire our muscles and diminishes our passion for working out.There are times when we cannot figure out if our workouts are effectively done the right way. If we choose to leave it to our instincts to decide, our physical health might be at risk. And we would need to empty our pockets to check our bodies with professional medical equipment. Now, this is why we need a smart fitness device at times.But the current fitness devices sold in the market can only calculate our heart rates and burnt calories. The fitness devices we usually attach to our arms or wrists cannot accurately calculate our activity levels as if they were to be attached to our thighs. (As thighs are where the actual active muscles are located). So we fully developed and applied the world's first muscle oxygen saturation calculating technology by attaching the devices to our thighs.Devices utilizing oxygen saturation levels were initially made for athletes. Still, we wanted to provide the general public access to a workout solution in a more convenient, simple, and professional way.As REPACE was developed after over 8 years of research, REPACE not only measures the muscle oxygen saturation levels. But, it can provide the users with a personalized running plan based on scientific algorithms and data.Stop running your longest and fastest miles. With REPACE, get your workout solution to fit your endurance and health levels based on scientific algorithms and data. You will be able to feel the change in your performance like a professional athlete.To measure the lactate threshold, runners needed special equipment, sports medicine experts, additional expenses, and must visit specific facilities. (And draw blood)But just with REPACE, it can all be done. Just simply fasten it on your thighs, and the users can measure their lactate threshold without having to draw blood and comprehensively analyze their current workout performance capacities.We realized that our workout performance tests and simple heartbeat monitoring were not enough. With REPACE's very own technological advancements, we developed an algorithm to make constant adjustments to provide more effective workout solutions.Based on the LT TEST, REPACE will provide you with the workout instructions in 3 different types based on individual workout levels and purposes.REPACE is more than just a simple running/ testing/ analyzing app. It can measure and provide a workout solution based on its previous records.REPACE is the world's first workout solution program providing an objective scientific way of working out. We will constantly develop REPACE to support Cycling, Mountain Climbing, and even strength trainings like Pilates and Weight Training based on our backers' feedback and internal system upgrades.Start working out according to your physical condition and choosing the appropriate workout intensity. You will become more fit and healthy through running. It is not easy for us to objectively figure out if we are working out the right way at the moment. But REPACE monitors the users' workout sessions in real-time. Based on this data, it provides vocal coaching guides to work out with.The compelling voice guides allow (to assist runners in reaching their goals) users to run at a steady speed to upgrade their physical abilities and motivate them to keep running.With the application of the BLE 5.0 technology, REPACE can save its collected data on to the application without any transmission errors. REPACE also allows users to instantly visualize their upgrading/degrading workout capacities by providing daily, monthly, and yearly statistical reports.The more you use REPACE, your workout skills will elevate, and you will always have your flawless personal trainer by your side.We all know that your favorite workouts will burn you out someday. So REPACE rewards the users with medals each time they workout to provide them a sense of new accomplishments. We are planned.It would feel nice to enhance our physical fitness but, wouldn't it be more exciting to find someone to workout together? You might motivate someone around you and partner up and join you! Start sharing your workout history with your friends on Facebook.Currently, REPACE is only equipped with the Facebook Friends system. More extra features and upgrades will be carried out based on our backers' feedback. Our lab will take a step further in our journey from our backers' growing love and interest in REPACE.REPACE measured the user's muscle oxygen saturation levels through functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). By tightening the device onto the user's thighs it can calculate the oxygen saturation levels (SmO2) and calculationREPACE automatically calculates the adequate workout duration and intensity through its application. Suppose REPACE is attached at a certain spot on your thighs. In that case, it can more accurately measure the exhaustion levels of your muscles. Check your fluctuating muscle oxygen saturation levels yourself.* When using REPACE outdoors, the users can check their running routes via a cellphone GPS. Users can also work out however they want, not following the workout solutions, and REPACE will check their SmO2 in real-time. ** REPACE is also pairable with an Apple Watch heart rate tracker and can check the users' heart rates in real-time as well. For accurate testing and a steady fixation, you would need to use the appropriate thigh bands. After the campaign successfully comes to a close, we will send out a survey for backers to receive the correctly-sized bands.Sit yourself down, place your legs on a chair, and measure the circumference of your thighs located 5 inches above your knee cap. This would be the adequate thigh band size to order when filling out the survey.We will provide an extra band for our backers! (Total of 2/ size mix & match available ⭕)OBELAB is a company initially started in the science lab of KAIST. NIRSIT is a portable device that could measure our brain's oxygen saturation levels with our very on fNIRS technology. Our expertise in our self-developed technology has been verified by the relative academia and industry. With our own technologies like these, we developed REPACE to upgrade our users' physical capacities. So, we would like to offer our backers the world's first hands-on experience on our device.After our Kickstarter campaign, we are planning to develop an algorithm to calculate the ratio of how many carbs/ fats are burnt while working out, based on our backers' feedback. (est. 2nd half of 2022). We genuinely hope to find the path to develop alongside our backers.OBELAB has developed and manufactured healthcare devices since 2013 and has been safety-approved with different certifications. Our self-developed technology has been developed by cooperating with the nation's top medical schools' algorithms and clinical trials to fully develop a complete device.The tests were carried out with the nation's expert medical school in sports medicine. They cooperated in academic and scientific certification and collaboration. REPACE is the first device for individual use (not for labs or hospitals). It will be the case where brain science technology has been applied to sports science. We are delighted to present REPACE to our backers, developed with our most extraordinary expertise and efforts. And we will try our best not to leave our backers to stay disappointed.This project is boosted by BackerCrew",

                "Text": " First of all, I would like to mention that we are building a prototype that is not intended for sale.Hello, and welcome to our project.We are Moritz, Amelia and Vincent from Landshut in Germanyand are currently studying at the Hans-Leinberger-Gymnasium Landshut.The idea for our project started with a class competition in our school: The task was to build a small car. The others in the class spent a lot of money on mini car kits on the internet, but we had an idea.Why not 3D print a drive? It's cheaper, smaller, and stronger. So we made a 3D model and printed it ... After we printed the rocket, the first test phase started:We fixed the rocket on a vice and connected it to a bag with pure oxygen. we used a sparkler to light it, then we squeezed the bag with oxygen so that the oxygen flows through the rocket. We found that the exhaust did not come out with a lot of pressure and that most of the rocket's  ABS was not burned. So we printed a new model with a smaller opening and an interior with high combustion efficiency.Second test phase:After the second test phase was quite successful, we test the flammability of two ABS parts printed in different ways. The part on the left of the video is the outer skin of the rocket the part on the right is made of the same material, just printed differently in order to burn perfectly in the interior of our rocket.Third test phase:In the next step we exchanged the oxygen bag for an oxygen bottle with 10 bar air pressure to find out whether the pressure of the oxygen plays a role.Through the test, we learned that more pressure is more thrust. The next step is the exact force measurement. In order to remove the human factor from the equation, we have to be able to precisely control the oxygen supply and this cannot be implemented with an oxygen cylinder. So we developed a concept to release the oxygen in a controlled manner: A kind of press that compresses a bag of oxygen.The model is not yet equipped with technology because it is still a small pre-print. For the problem that comes up now, we need your support: In order to supply a test-ready amount of oxygen, a larger press is required, and we are not able to pay for the technology for this ourselves. We also need a larger and more precise 3D printer in order to develop more complex rockets and the press in the future. We will also make a metal shell for the rocket, which will enable us to exchange the rocket after use and to recycle it to make new rockets from it.Personal words:With our project we want to build a prototype. In addition, with this project we are taking part in a German youth research competition, which gives us better chances of getting a renumed university place if we get a good placement.We hope you like our project :)All the best,Moritz, Ameila and Vincent",

                "Text": "Hi everyone! My name is Mihai and I am a software developer who wants to create useful things that add value to people's lives. In the past, I created Fakey (https://fakey.osome.iu.edu/) which is a media literacy fake-news game that has gotten some attention. I also built a lot of other creations in the goal-tracking and automation space which you can find on my website (https://mihaisplace.com)The problem?Earlier this year I wanted to buy a new gaming console, and to my chagrin, every time I saw releases being hyped in the news, I was always too late to buy it as it went out of stock very quickly. This was a major pain point for me and I had a vision that this process should be much simpler. A person should be texted as soon as an item is back in stock so that they can increase their chances of buying it. This is how the idea for the Item Tracker was born with the notion of creating a software tool that can ping us as soon as something we are seeking is back in stock. Why solve this problem now? With the onset of the global pandemic and international supply chains struggling, it has been difficult to get some items that we seek which have been out-of-stock or heavily backlogged. Some clear examples of this that always surface in the news involve the next-gen console shortages where it has been incredibly difficult to buy new PS5s, Xbox Series Xs, and GPUs. I also believe this situation will only get worse as supply chains will further get strained as we use up our planet's supply of raw materials.What have I built so far?Currently, the software I built involves sites where someone can subscribe to the new PS5 and Xbox Series S/X. If someone subscribes, they will get a text to the phone number they provide as soon as the console comes back in stock in any stores. With just a few small private and public launches in the last couple of months, these sites have seen hundreds of users, and dozens of subscribers. I can see that there is some value here and it is solving a problem, which is something I am very happy with.Here is how the sites look belowThe ask?Right now I am providing the service for free and it costs me about $100/mo. to upkeep the servers and technology that can enable the service to work. This will likely not be sustainable for me for long unless I have some funding to justify continuing the service. What's more is that in the future I would like to expand this service to include the new Nintendo OLED, different types of GPUs, trading cards, clothes, and any other supplies that will fall into this category of items that are highly sought after, for which there is very low supply. After building the basic functionality for these services, I would like to create a tool that can help broker a place in line for people who are wanting to buy something of low supply. This way, if someone wants to buy a new item, they can simply pre-fill a request to buy and it will be purchased automatically on their behalf - completely automating the process and removing the burden of having the person vying for a slot to purchase it themselves. Finally, I plan to create a wiki with tips on how people can boost their chances of buying various items they seek that are in low supply.Here is the timeline for the product- Tracker service for the Nintendo OLED and popular GPUs (1 - 2 months)- Item tracker tips wiki (1 - 2 months)- Tracker service for other sought after items coming from user interviews (3 - 6 months)- Fully automated item purchaser service (6 - 12 months)- Improving the services to be as quick, fair, and secure as possible (1 - 2 years)In conclusion,I hope you consider working alongside me on this product. You can see from the Rewards section that I plan to build alongside all of you and really help you drive the effort or features via 1 on 1 conversation and focus groups. I am simply here to serve and solve your problems in getting the items you seek. Finally, I will share all the details of the process and adopt a mindset of building in the open with transparency in mind. Thank you for reading this far if you have, hope you have a great day regardless of whether you fund this project!Warm regards,~ Mihai",

                "Text": "Hi, my name is Matteo Prasso, and here's my friend Haris Bashir. We always wanted to create something from scratch, so we met online during the 2021 Covid lockdown, and  started working on this project. We met then in real life and became good friends and co-workers.We are prototyping a pair of shoes with two electric motors and four wheels with detachable shafts. The product will include both the electronic/ tech part and the footwear, attached one on the top of the other.  Talking about tech things, we designed it with two electric motors that give high speed and high torque, in order to reach 12 kph or 7.5 mph. Each shoe will have a battery under the center of the foot, the transmission, and two detachable shafts that connect to the four wheels. You will be able to control the speed thanks to the pressure sensors put inside the sole.One of our goals is to make this product easy and comfy to wear everywhere, so we studied the detachable shafts that permit you to use the Sheels also indoors. For example, in many places like schools or offices, you can't wear rollers skates and you must have a pair of common shoes to use there, so you need a place to put the skates when you are not using them. With this product you will forget these problems; once you enter into a structure you can remove the wheels, and put them back when you leave. Another of our goals, that we will reach with experience of prototyping, is to make a foldable, but stable, sole that will help you in the step.On the aesthetic appearance, is our goal on the final product to make every pair unique. We are currently designing a lot of customizable parts that will integrate a basic model. You will be able to choose between different options of led lights designs, colors, the lateral bumpers, the designs of the wheels, and much more. We are doing this because we want the user to find an identity in this product and stand out. We want to share with the people our idea of freedom of spirit. Many times happens in the commuting life that the trip becomes just \"necessary\"; we start seeing it as a boring thing we have to do to reach our destination. We died of boredom from this for years,  so we asked ourselves what could change this everyday routine.  We wanted to create real emotions that could help people live better the day.  Something that was more than a simple pair of shoes; something that could give speed, fun, and excitement. Imagine a life where you can move around at a certain speed with just your feet,  feeling free from all the things that stress you, and reach your destination with a free spirit and ready to start. How would it be? We are currently designing our first prototype, and very soon we will 3d print it; this will help us to give a representative shape of the product and will become the display model. At the same time, we are building the first working prototype, with actual motors, battery, controls, and wheels. For this one, we are using a simple shoe bought in a shop and the case will be printed again in plastic.  For the component, we already invested money, and every time we want to develop we have to use more. As the project rises, also expenses do. To obtain the best result possible we need the best materials and the best components. We want to keep the product the lightest possible for perfect use, to do that we need a carbon fiber case for example, but also the electronics must take less space, and also the battery could be more powerful with less weight.  So we are doing a campaign on Kickstarter to make something unique, perfect and create a community with which we can connect and share our passion for this product.We want to pursue our dream and goal to create something good and fun for people. We can see the potential of this product to unite and make people share time together. Thanks to the speed, people will be able to race, make obstacle courses, and go downtown or to skateparks together. We imagine groups of friends sharing times to choose their perfect customization of a pair of Sheels, or also family members designing together their most liked style. We all know after Covid, how important and precious is the time spent with the people that make us feel good, so we want to give opportunities to have something to share with the people we love the most.Here's our Instagram to follow the progress: @hercurymotion For more infos please contact: hercury.company@gmail.com ",

Equipped with a 5MP camera, 6 LED lights and a wifi connected app, we provide an experience like no other.As you are using the flosser, you will be able to clearly see every area that needs cleaning. With some smart technology and programming, none of your problem areas will be left untouched. Braces, for example, are no match for the pulsating water stream of the SUNUO.You can control the SUNUO Intelligent Visual Water Flosser in our App. 3 different camera modesWater flow pressure adjustmenChoose water flossing mode and turn the SUNUO onMoreover, you can choose to take pictures in black and white or color, as well as flip the images.You can download the proprietary app via QR code or the link on the instructions. Once you download it, choose your language and begin the best water flossing experience of your life.Featuring a water pressure which can reach around 140 PSI, SUNUO produces a thin, precise water stream. Unlike other water flossers, ours pulsates the water stream at around 1600 pulsations per minute. This helps to effectively remove any food particles that may be stuck, or dental plaque that’s usually difficult to clean.Driving the water flow is a frictionless pump. The settings of the water pressure can be adjusted to fit the needs of your individual mouth.For a tool that will touch the inside of your mouth, it is important to maintain cleanliness. The SUNUO uses UV sterilizers, one is for sanitizing and cleaning the nozzle, the other one is for sanitizing and preventing bacterial growth. Through this redundant system, there is no way for bacteria to remain, thus keeping your mouth safe and healthy.The SUNUO is equipped with 3 different nozzles, which aims for satisfying the needs of anyone who may use our product.Standard nozzle: For daily cleaning and oral carePeriodontal nozzle: For cleaning the gums. A soft and narrow nozzleOrthodontic nozzle: For those with braces. Since there are more gaps and dead angles around braces, it is hard to clean properly with a toothbrush. The orthodontics nozzle is professionally designed with narrow and tiny brushes.3 Pressure Modes: gentle, standard, and spa modes are supported, allowing you to choose a suitable water pressure.The design of the SUNUO brilliantly hides its nozzle. You only need to gently pull out the nozzle to use it. This keeps the nozzle tucked away for hygienic purposes, as well as for more compact storage.One of the main features of the SUNUO is the large 180 ml water tank. The reason we can make the capacity so large is due to the collapsible nature of it. When in storage mode, the water tank won’t take up any extra space in your purse or bag. When you need to rinse your teeth, just pull on the water tank, fill it up, and rinse away.We want to give you the freedom to choose how to clean your mouth, so we’ve also added the option to use mouthwash instead of water.The SUNUO comes with a 2000mAh battery. This amount of power is enough to use for 50 minutes at one time. No matter if it's a wall adapter, PC, laptop, or  power bank, you always have an option to keep your SUNUO fully charged.The waterproofing level is IPX7, so you can use it while washing your face or taking a shower. The SUNUO team is dedicated to improving oral hygiene and maintaining cleanliness. We believe and support healthy habits and lifestyles. We’ve turned our passion for cleaning products into cleaning of teeth and gums. This product turns out to be easy to use, comfortable and most important of all, an effective solution to maintain your oral hygiene. Therefore, in terms of product design, the inventing process, or the choices for accessories, we have maintained a very strict standard throughout the whole process. We’ve worked really hard to bring better products to our customers.Q1: What are the causes of itching or gum bleeding?A1: You might bleed because your gums are not used to this high water pressure, your gums are weak, or you have periodontal disease. However, if it hasn’t stopped after one week or you still feel pain, please consult your dentist.Q2: What is the suggested mode for a beginner?A2: We suggest you use the soft mode for the first time.Q3:After using the water flosser, do I still need to brush my teeth?A3: Our water flosser is not a substitute for a toothbrush. On one hand, a toothbrush can clean out most of the plaque on the surface. On the other hand, the water flosser is mainly used for cleaning the dead angles and blind sides where a toothbrush cannot properly reach. So, this product is complementary to the toothbrush.Q4:Will the water stream hurt my gums if the water pressure is strong?A4: The SUNUO Intelligent Visual Water Flosser uses pulsating pressure technology, which creates a soft water stream and ensures cleaning effectiveness. When used properly, it won’t hurt your gums.Q5:How can I replace the nozzle?A5: You can simply loosen it like a screw and it should come right off.Q6:Why can't I turn it off right away after usage?A6: The pump will activate sleep mode every 2 minutes while not in use. The light signals will be off. If there is no connection for Wi-Fi, the camera and Wi-Fi signal light will be turned off after 2 minutes.Q7:When I use it, does it make any noise?A7: When in use, some noise will be generated and will stay within the 70dB range.Q8:Should I only use cold water?A8: You should use water lower than 38°C (100°F).Q9:How can I properly operate the water flosser?A9: Hold the water flosser upright and extend the nozzle into your mouth, aiming for gaps or gums. Clean along the teeth, slowly and sequentially.",

                "Text": "TWS earphones. Familiar names, boxy looks, and the old-fashioned popping-hood design. It’s the golden formula of mediocrity. We are here to re-write the formula. You want all the features, we give them all, plus a design from the future.We are talking deep here. Earphones from the future aren’t just limited by the looks, but the open-casing that makes wearing the earphone in just 1 second; the half-in-ear design yet active noise cancellation; the LDAC codec that plays CD-level quality music into your ear and finally, the combination of space aluminum material and Anti-Glare glass that packs every wonder into small and streamline-shaped TWS  earphonesWe combine creative design, sublime comfort, and unparalleled audio performance together,  making X-BOAT PRO quite different from other TWS earphones. Popping the hood is normal for earphones. But why bother when you don’t have to?With an open-casing design, we eliminated the drop-top hood. Taking the headphone is just a slide away instead of case-opening and buds fumbling. Enjoying music is only one slide-to-unlock away.With a single-hand operation mechanism, you can wear earphones with ease in any busy-hand environment like taking the subway, working, shopping, phone calls. Easy to use does not mean easy to drop. With integrated magnets, the earphones stay light but firm in the case. Light tipping or 180° flipping, this pair is staying.With the open-casing design, you will never have to pop the hood to check that if you are bringing both earphones or not. Everything is in a glimpse.It's easy to find ANC earphones these days---when they were full-in-ear ones. There’s nothing wrong with such a design, except when you put them on for a long time, the shape starts to block the ear canal, adding unnecessary pressure. We took a harder yet different approach, the half-in-ear solution. X-BOAT PRO combines the most advanced ANC algorithm and large drivers to bring you a new listening experience from true wireless audio. This means you can hear less noise and more music playing.The earphones are ergonomically molded to precisely fit your ear.  It's just 3.9g each, offering a weightless way and more comfortable wearing experience even after long hours of use - Survivor of the fittest, winner of the quietest.Why X-BOAT PRO can deliver CD Audio quality. We know you can’t hear now. But data will tell youThe most common audio codec for earphones is the SBC codec, with which the maximum sample bit-rate is still lossy 320 Kbps.  With LDAC, your Bluetooth audio device can now transfer up to 3x the data consistently compared to SBC---in short, you can enjoy non-stop 100% CD audio quality on your X-BOAT PRO.The large 13 mm LCP dynamic driver inside each earphone delivers bass you can feel in your bone. lets you experience the soaring melodies and rich timbres of all your favorite tunes.Plus, the Integrated Class AB Hi-Fi amplifier can bring optimal audio performance and power efficiency. We built the charging case of X-BOAT PRO under the same material as a phone. The touch feeling is quite different from other TWS earphones.With CNC, we get to carve the shape out as one perfect piece of metal with zero gaps. The Anti-glare Glass processing adds one extra layer of texture that leaves no fingerprints but millions of colors under the sun. With a built-in Airoha 5.2 chip, X-BOAT PRO is able to adapt smarter power management during the playing process, achieving a stunning 40-hour playback time. You might forget to charge it quite often simply because you don't need to.     Plus, You can plug the X-BOAT PRO into your phone (Type-C port) for charging. Connect the headphones for just 20 minutes, and you can expect the X-BOAT PRO to run an additional 5 hours. With long battery life, you can keep X-BOAT PRO everywhere with you. Never worried run out of juice while on the go.Lotus awaiting for blossom is, in our eyes, the perfect combination of body curve and visual lightness. The design of XBOAT PRO chased our fantasy for such beauty with its unique earphone holster structure and 100% stream-lined shape. The charging bay of Xboat is largely covered in aluminum with meticulous machining of 5-axis CNC to mimic the shape of nature, while the ever-glowing color flying through your eyes. The design was a huge challenge. Not only did we have to get the shape right, but also we must adjust the sizing of earphones for both charging bay and ear fitting. In terms of sound quality, we managed to level up the game even higher: we chose LCP dynamic driver instead of titanium diaphragm driver for better sound quality and, later, we built a connection with SONY officials for a product review. They eventually gave permission to authorize the LDAC codecs to X-boat Pro for its overall performance. The outcome of all the efforts costs more to make the product but also gives a better user experience to customers. Our vision is to build a set of people’s earphones with supreme music performance while looking good when putting it on. With the front side representing the future, the back pays tribute to the past. The Anti-glare glass with PET filming cast a mist to create a mystical contrast between itself and the shining body, like a sexy creation from Hajime Sorayama in a modern mask, blending the sci-fi past of industrial design to a flattened, more simplified future. On top of visual language, we also tried very hard in making a perfect front chamber---like twenty times iteration hard---to achieve absolute comforts when you put the earphone on, and the smooth feeling when you slide the earphones in or out of the charging bay. As for the earphone, we chose vacuum plating + skin-like coating to make it feel elegant, look sharp, yet keep stealthy when in use. Xboat is our attempt to express technological beauty with nature language---metals are cold, but humanity isn’t.Spending years of time in the earphone business taught us a tough fact: from concept with exceptional design to production-ready stands a wall of sacrifice lists for higher efficiency and yield rate. By the time customers got their hands on the actual product, what they see would become a bland, mediocre product lacking beauty or basic user experience. YOBYBO wasn’t born to be this way. Our goal is to give birth to a design that follows our hearts from the very beginning. Instead of simplifying the process for the industry, we chose to keep the precious creative design as it intended to be, no matter how much harder it would be to build. The product we built is the mirror of our vision.The higher our guidelines would be, the more procedures we had to go through. We set up more product inspections for a more reliable industrial renovation to make sure our products meet the global standard for a good one. If we had to choose between the cost and quality, we would definitely go to the latter one.We were the creators of the world’s thinnest TWS earphones---CARD20, which won the Reddot and iF design award of 2020. Our push-to-unlock NOTE20 won the Reddot design award as well.We reviewed our entire streamline of the production of these two products: from concept to engineering, development, till the final manufacturing. All the problems were put under the telescope for improvements of our next-gen product.Now here we are with X-boat Pro. A better statement for a better time.This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 2,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $900M raised between them.",

                "Text": "MODZI came about because my brother is a germaphobe and I wanted to help him. All throughout childhood, and into the present, he refuses to touch doorknobs, elevator buttons, etc. You name it, he won’t touch it, and if he does, he’s looking for the nearest sink to wash his hands. That may not be everybody’s life, but lately we’ve all become very hygiene-conscious--and that’s a good thing.We never anticipated inventing an actual product for market, but when I saw my crude prototype excited my brother, I decided we needed to share it with the world. Our line of MODZI hand sanitizing products are convenient and unique - NO messy refilling! Just swap out an empty Pod for a fresh, pre-filled sanitizer Pod when you need it. We also use LIQUID hand sanitizer vs. gel, so no sticky hands! Make hand sanitizing an afterthought, meet MODZI.The MODZI Band is a wrist wearable for easy hand sanitizing access. You can easily swap out an empty sanitizer Pod for a fresh, pre-filled Pod. All Pods are filled with FDA approved, liquid sanitizer made in the US and spray directly into your palm. The MODZI Band features similar, compact dimensions of most smart watches.The idea for MODZI began four years ago with a brother and sister team, BJ and Sunnye, one of which is a lifelong germaphobe. Along the way, as the idea developed, our team grew as well - all with a like-minded vision. We feel fortunate to have partnered with a group of experienced engineers, manufacturers and creatives to bring our vision to life.Let’s face it though, startups are never cheap. As a brother and sister duo, we’re a true grassroots team - all we had was an idea and a living room to work in...oh and about 8 months of mandatory lockdown and plenty of free time on our hands. We definitely learned a lot along the way!If we’re fortunate enough to fund our Kickstarter with your help, a large amount of campaign funds will go towards the initial molds needed to produce MODZI Bands & MODZI Pods at the minimum order quantities required by our manufacturers. As well, we feel it’s important to have a surplus of product so our backers, and beyond, can access pre-filled replacement Pods in the future.Every Pod we ship is pre-filled with FDA approved, liquid sanitizer fulfilled in the US. Click button below to pick a tier and start backing MODZI! Have no fear, you can always ADD ON Pod Refill Packs or extra Starter Packs to your pledge.The beauty of the MODZI Band are the MODZI Pods - small, pre-filled, spray Pods that fit perfectly in the band. Each Pod delivers over 100 ample sprays of liquid sanitizer. The MODZI Pods can be used without the band if that’s more your style. Utilizing our convenient clip hole, attach a Pod to your keychain, lanyard, backpack, etc. or simply put ‘em in your pocket, purse or glove box if you choose and spray directly into the palm of your hand when you need!The MODZI Band was made with people and convenience in mind. It’s a discreet and stylish way to sanitize your hands while you go about your day - wherever you are, whatever you’re doing. The wristband is reusable, durable and quite comfortable if we do say so ourselves. It fits on most wrists and features similar, compact dimensions of most smart watches.No more messy refilling, figuring out where to put your used sanitizer wipes or hunting for that pump bottle that somehow disappeared or is always empty. When your MODZI Pod runs low, no problem. Just remove it from the Band, pop in a new Pod and you’ve got over 100 fresh, new sprays all on your wrist or in your pocket.Whether you’re right or left handed, our MODZI Band is your friend. With a team of engineers, we spent quite a bit of time during the design stage crafting the band and micro tooling the Pod to make it ergonomically perfect. Simply press the button on your Pod and a full spray is delivered right into your palm. Our Pods were designed to use almost every drop of sanitizer inside & also engineered to spray a full stream from any angle.Another goal was to make it multi-functional. Who doesn’t like that? MODZI Pods can be used independently of the band as well, just pop a couple in your purse, pocket, stroller or laptop bag and use as needed. You can even attach MODZI Pods to your car keys, lanyards, backpacks and so on utilizing the engineered clip hole.Everyone really - all ages, lifestyles and occupations could benefit from our MODZI products. Our MODZI products are the perfect way to sanitize on-the-go simply and discreetly.Everywhere!

MODZI is being made possible by you, and we want you to be a part of the creative process as well. While we strongly believe in the many benefits of the MODZI Band and MODZI Pods, we aren't claiming to cure any illness or condition. MODZI does not replace the effectiveness of hand washing. Our goal is style and convenience while on-the-go or in situations where immediate hand washing is not an option.",

It should be able to stand up to bladed attacks, have fire and chemical resistance, provide protection from most melee-based attacks, and maybe, just maybe, even limited bullet resistance. We are simply college students looking for funding to complete an educational, fun, and challenging design project and we need your help.

What it does from there is obviously very different though.Get more focus out of your day and get work done faster, as you’re always only one notification or tap away from Rocket's effective focus timers. Rocket makes it such a mentally easy decision to get started on some work (and actually do it).Rocket helps you rethink your work as a challenge rather than a chore. This makes you much more likely get you into what psychologists call ‘flow’ (it happens when the challenge of a task and your abilities are perfectly matched).Disrupt existing bad tech habits. Over time Rocket helps you become more conscious of how much you use your phone and more aware of the effect of behavioural design on your actions.Just like with any other skill, you can train your focus. At the end of each timer you're prompted to ask yourself if you were focused or distracted. This forms an instant feedback loop that trains your mind to avoid the things that cause you to become distracted. We also give you tips to help you build better habits around your tech use.Being the place of focus, Rocket is naturally a hub of thoughtful people, great ideas and insightful reflections. See beyond what you usually see on the surface.We donate to offset 1.2kg of CO2 for every hour of focus on Rocket. So far we have contributed towards projects that provide clean drinking water to Rwandan communities & help bring new innovative waste management practices to Vietnam. See more here.Completing a timer of focus feels SO satisfying. Rocket also helps you celebrate the small wins by rewarding you after every timer and every task you complete :)You can use Rocket for anything from 30 mins of focus per day to a full day of focus. Since it fits right in with your existing productivity tools, it's not a hassle to set up and you don't have to rely on using it all the time.Note: We will never sell ads, and never sell your data. So Rocket will cost $10/month to keep us running.Available on iOS and Android. Should run smoothly on any smartphone less than 3 years old.Our early testers have collectively focused for more than 70000 minutes so far out of just ~75000 minutes of Rocket timers (yep, people are very rarely distracted when using Rocket).We have also been actively involved in the local startup community here in Sydney, Australia. We've been learning heaps, participating in a bunch of courses, programs and pitch nights.Hey I'm Cameron, the young solo creator of Rocket. It's been an amazing yet incredibly challenging journey so far. I've been playing the 3 startup roles all at once. This is possible as I am lucky enough to be alive at time where building a business can be done solo (albeit not easily) and in a part of the world with an abundance of resources and opportunity.Thank you to my incredible support network of mentors, advisors and everyone else who has helped along the way!What got me started?I never imagined that one day I would build a social media. Truth be told I've never liked social media that much. This all began as I was simply interested in improving my productivity. I was never good at being able to focus on my work unless I had a tight deadline breathing down my neck. This was always stressful and I lost a lot of time to procrastination.Through around 2 years of research and experimentation with multiple ideas it became clear to me that the biggest problem most of us face is distractions. Our 200 000 year old brains have not evolved to handle the vast amounts of information and context switching that we experience 24/7 in the Information Age. We pick up our phones 150 times per day on average (once every 6.5 minutes). Our ‘attention residue’, a term psychologists use, is spread everywhere, drastically reducing our cognitive performance. One study even found that it takes us on average 23 minutes to get focused on a task after a distraction. But that’s just the start of the rabbit hole...Why make Rocket?We happen to live in an attention economy, where there is a strong economic incentive for pretty much all products – apps, websites, social medias, media, etc – to battle for your attention through whatever means possible. Our phones are a gateway to our attention.Technology is improving at an amazing rate, and every year our phones become a larger part of our lives. It follows that technology is manipulating away more and more of our attention.At what point do we lose control of our attention completely? What will that mean for humanity?We’re simply not doing enough to avoid this catastrophe waiting to happen. We can’t wait for regulators to step in or wait for Big Tech to grow a conscience. I believe it is a necessity to do something about this before it’s too late. With Rocket I think I can play a part in helping drive some consumer awareness and build more demand for better technology that respects our attention.Venture Capital is great for some startups, however it necessitates aiming for crazy never-ending growth / profit above all else (and yes, sometimes profit above customers' wellbeing).We believe we have to do things very differently, and that includes not taking the conventional Venture Capital path. We are really relying on your support to get off the ground. Not going to lie - we currently have a shoestring marketing budget, so we are relying on the proceeds from this campaign to kickstart our marketing and launch.To take a step to stand up for our attention, please support our Kickstart campaign.Fast as a Rocket's Terms of Service can be found here.",

                "Title": "Elasto | Ergonomic Light Click Mouse",
                "Text": "INTRODUCINGOur patented elastic click design removes the bottom of the mouse and frees your hands from the very uncomfortable experience of batting your finger against a hard surface hundreds of thousands of times.The above shows the skeleton of a typical mouse. The kind of mouse you have been using from your first encounter with a PC until now. Microswitches are located at the front of the mouse. They are the components that make the crisp click sound when you press down the mouse button.THE PROBLEM IS that the switches lie below your fingertip. So when you click the button, your fingertip collides with the switch. Subsequently your finger, hand, and arm are injured.In jargon, actuation distance and travel distance (there is a Glossary down this page!) are almost the same. This structure makes bottoming out so easy. In other words, it makes you slam your finger on the button. This is what we call an incident of a 'mouse-crash'.Elasto's bottomless structure involves the Principle of the Lever.So you need to apply only half of the actuation force to click the Elasto.Well, what about when you double-click?As the above graphic shows, double-clicking the typical mouse produces high and somewhat impact forces. In comparison, double-clicking the Elasto mouse produces low and smooth forces. This is because Elasto has a longer overtravel distance and uses the principle of the lever. You can click lightly with Elasto. More lightly than you can ever imagine.We promise ELASTO will save your hands.Among ergonomic mice, the most widespread type is the vertical mouse. The vertical mouse has an interesting concept of rotating the orientation of the hand to 45° to 90° compared to the typical mouse. Manufacturers claim that a typical mouse places your wrist in unnatural angles while the handshake position of the vertical mouse is natural.Some people love the vertical mouse. Since their arm and hand positions have changed, previously overused muscles come to a pause. So their wrist pain is somewhat relieved.Can you click a vertical mouse without using your thumb?No.The vertical mouse will not stay steady unless your thumb supports it while the buttons are being clicked. In other words, your thumb and index finger must be involved in a 'pinching grip' to click. No wonder why my thumb was sore using the vertical mouse.Scientific findings support this. Dr. David Rempel¹ and his colleagues conducted a series of research to examine factors affecting carpal tunnel pressure. They found in 1997 that carpal tunnel pressure increases when the wrist position is in unneutral angles and when the fingertip is carrying out a pressing task². A year later, they found that carpal tunnel pressure was even higher when pinching than simply pressing³. This means that clicking-and-dragging is worse than just clicking because a pinching grip is sustained.This leads us to conclude that vertical mice can actually increase wrist tension. This could answer why wrist pain did not go away even when you changed to a vertical mouse.¹ Dr. David Rempel is a Professor Emeritus in the Department of Medicine at UC San Francisco and Faculty in the Ergonomics Laboratory at UC Berkeley.² Rempel, D.M., Keir, P.J., Smutz, W.P., and Hargens, A., 1997. Effects of static fingertip loading on carpal tunnel pressure. Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 15(3), pp.422-426.³ Keir, P.J., Bach, J.M., and Rempel, D.M., 1998. Fingertip loading and carpal tunnel pressure: differences between a pinching and a pressing task. Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 16(1), pp.112-115.If you answered ‘yes’ to any of the questions above, we strongly encourage you to try the Elasto mouse. Elasto’s buttons are awesome. Not only do they provide amazing comfort, but they feel satisfying. Bouncy, chewy, resilient, elastic - you define it when you get it. You’ve got to feel it to judge it. You will be amazed at how light Elasto’s buttons are!POWER MODE at your convenienceYour Elasto will arrive with an AA battery installed for you. However, if you would like to enjoy the benefit of a rechargeable mouse, we devised the Elasto so you can easily switch mode to a rechargeable mouse. Insert a rechargeable lithium-ion battery and set to Li-ion mode on the Elasto. Charge with a USB-C cable to keep it going. (Note: Li-ion battery and USB-C cable are not included.)WIRELESS MODE of your selectionElasto provides Bluetooth freedom. No Bluetooth? No problem. Plug in the provided 2.4G USB dongle and you’re good to go.a. Travel distance\nThe distance from the top of the button (unpressed) to the bottom of the button (when pressed all the way down to fully bottom out). Travel distance is the sum of pretravel and overtravel distance.b. Actuation (actuation point, actuation distance, actuation force)When you push downward the mouse button, in most cases with a tactile bump, the switch is actuated. Actuation point refers to the point when electrical contact is made (i.e., the switch turns “on”). Actuation distance is the distance from the top of the button (unpressed) to actuation point. Actuation force is the force needed to reach the actuation point. You must press the key to this amount in order for the switch to be recognized. Mouse switches with high actuation force require stronger force, while switches with low actuation force are light to press. This value depends on the switch manufacturer such as Omron, Kailh, etc.c. Applied force\nApplied force is the amount of force used to press a button. When applied force exceeds actuation force, this suggests excessive strain or bottoming out the button. Minimizing applied force by all means is strongly recommended for sound hands. This can be achieved by clicking gently (your job) or devising a mouse with a low actuation force (click switch or mouse manufacturer’s job).d. PretravelBefore reaching the point of actuation, the button descends some distance. This is ‘pretravel’. This prevents erratic switch actuation.e. Overtravel\nAfter the point of actuation, the button may be able to move further downwards. In this case, electrical contact is made (i.e., the switch turns “on”) before the button is fully depressed. The additional distance that the button can continue to be pressed after actuation is ‘overtravel’. Overtravel means that buttons do not have to be struck hard or pressed all the way down. When overtravel is provided, chances of finger fatigue are low particularly when using the mouse at a high rate of speed. Elasto’s bottomless structure using the lever allows the longest overtravel among any button-clicking mouse.The birth of Elasto dates back to 2018. Elasto’s founder Unice was troubled with her puffy sore index finger joint, numb forearm, and tension in the hand after working on the computer mouse 16 hours a day. She tried alternative mice – including ergonomically vertical mice – but after a few days of seeming relief, she felt pain again in different parts this time.Her loving father Sang heard Unice complaining about her discomfort. As an engineer who devoted his life to the study of mechatronics, he immediately figured out what the problem was in a typical mouse.Collision = Shock = Harm to hand. (Newton’s third law)He found an aged-to-yellow mouse from the storage. He adjusted it so that the mouse button had a longer travel distance than what the default Omron microswitch provided — longer overtravel distance, to be precise.Unice began using the reformed mouse. Some weeks later, she surprisingly found that she had completely forgotten about finger pain. Her arm was also improving. At last Unice’s hand was safe. However, as time passed, there were some issues regarding durability. So the prototype was modified multiple times before Unice and Sang decided to make mice as a business.Unice and Sang are specialists in observing and releasing bodily tension. They both are certified Alexander Technique (AT) teachers. For a total of 13 years, they have been helping numerous students refrain from engaging in harmful habits of posture and tension and guiding healthier ones. According to AT, you are eligible to consciously inhibit yourself from pounding on the computer mouse. If you are careful, you would click gently with little tension. No doubt that this is true in all circumstances. However, not all of you are trained to consciously control how you live your body. For instance, it is close to impossible to consciously control your clicking habit when you are in a state of mind completely immersed in what you are doing on a computer. As ‘tension releasing specialists’, team Elasto designed the invention so that your hands don’t get tense without having you even know it.

                "Text": "Hello, and thanks for taking the time to read my story. I'm Vanessa, a 39 year old single mother of two beautiful children; 14 year old girl and 11 year old boy. For all of my adult life I have been the planner/organizer of events in the family. I am the last of 10 children so...very big and lively family! I've planned, coordinated and executed events big and small from birthday parties, to most recently, weddings. I thoroughly enjoy doing this kind of work so I thought to create an events management business that would allow me to put my talents to good use and also create a legacy for my children. Just as I was gearing up to get things going (began my Master's certificate in Event Management program), the COVID-19 Pandemic hit the nation. With COVID came the state and country-wide mandated \"stay-at-home orders.\" I realized that this climate may not be the best time to start my business as envisioned, for the very simple fact that its success relies heavily on people gathering together for these different occasions. I was able to complete my Event Management Master's Certificate program this past July (2021) and I felt reinvigorated to get my first endeavor started. I set out to see how I could do something else (in the meantime) that would satisfy a need that has gone unmet for a number of years. With the help of my two little ones, and after a lot of hours brainstorming and consulting with the people I trust; I landed on the idea that I am bringing to you all now. A mobile application. One that will provide a means for Event Professionals (Event Managers, Planners, Caterers, Decorators, Photographers, etc.) to network, collaborate, and better meet the needs of their clients. I landed on this idea for a few reasons: 1) because after years of planning various events, my experience (which was in line with the market research) was that there was no seamless way to acquire event professionals or vendors outside of google searches and/or utilizing existing relationships; 2) There were various apps out there that aid in the event planning process, but nothing that directly focuses on connecting event professionals and their clients ; and 3) Even with COVID, I saw a steady uptick of in-person events around the country; toward the last quarter of the year folks began having their events. The events were looking a little different due to the observance of the COVID-19 safety guidelines, but they were still being held. I saw the need for my App grow as it would assist in filling the gap and helping those in the industry like myself, and their clients get connected more efficiently. To that end, I wrote out the details of what I'd like the features of the App to be and I began scouting for App Developers. App Features and Functionality- Users will be required to sign-up/register on the app, they will create a profile either as a client or an event professional. Event professionals will pay a subscription fee to join, Clients will be able to sign up for free. -Clients will be able to create a post detailing the services they require for their event - Event Professionals (service providers) will be required create a profile for their business/service that provides clients with the business name, a description of services, ratings and reviews from past customers, a portfolio, and any packages if available. -Event Professionals will review clients' job posts and submit a proposal for service.-Clients will review and compare all proposals directly inside the app. They will be able to contact the service provider via the application and select the package and scope of services in the application. - All services acquired for a specific event will be housed in the app under that event posting. Clients will be able to connect and communicate with all their service providers in one place via app chat for each of their events. - Clients will be able to submit ratings for each vendor at the conclusion of their contract. Ratings will be added to the service providers profile. - Service providers will be ranked on the app according to these ratings. Highly rated service providers will get more exposure on the app and therefore more job offers.I connected with four companies for development. After reviewing proposals from each, I decided to go with the company offering the best quality and most comprehensive service. I am currently in phase 3 out of 4 of development and I am requesting your support to push through to completion and marketing. I believe that this app will have a significant impact on this industry and I'd like you to be a part of it. Thanks in advance for your generosity!",

                "Text": "If you live in a place where tap water is considered potable, you are either:i) Drinking water from the tap (with no post-treatment)ii) Drinking post-treated tap water. Post treatments can be multiple (from simple devices like a water pitcher to reverse osmosis)Whether you are in scenario i) and ii), we have two questions for you:1) Do you really know what is in your tap water?2) Are you using the right water post-treatment?Difficult questions, right? Don’t worry, you don’t need to answer. We will give you the answer to these questions.The quality of your tap water at home can vary and depends on many factors such as the region where you live, your municipal water supply, etc.…Think about the distance traveled by water from the outlet of your municipal water treatment plant to your kitchen’s faucet. You have probably already heard about water lead contamination due to old pipelines, or plastic microfibers pollution due to legal or illegal discharge of containers in water sources, or even organic pesticides. Pollutants can leak out of wastewater treatment and industrial plants and enter the water supply.Therefore, tap water can contain pollutants as microplastics, pesticides, heavy metals, chlorine, fluoride, lead and even radioactive compounds. These pollutants can be harmful for your health if not maintained at low concentrations or traces. Even when kept at the level of traces, pollutants can lead to long-term health issues.Many people across the globe use a water pitcher to filter and store tap water before drinking it.Did you know that most of the water pitchers available in the market (including most famous brands) are not capable to filter most of the pollutants that might be in your tap water? Some pollutants are partially removed, most not at all.Ok you maybe knew that…but did you know about the breeding ground problem in water pitchers? Did you hear about secondary water pollution?Let us explain…city water contains bacteria coming from biofilm (bacteria that grow in the surface) in the pipes. Water pitcher cartridges are playgrounds for bacteria and microorganisms to grow and develop. This increased concentration of bacteria can threaten the safety of your water. While your pitcher cartridge is filtering some pollutants from your tap water, it is adding and increasing bacteria and microorganisms in your tap water.You are probably asking yourself…what’s now? How can I drink my tap water being sure that all the harmful pollutants and bacteria are filtered out?BluAct Technologies has the solution for you. BluAct All-in-one is a water filtration system capable to filter all the pollutants you might find in your tap water and to protect your water from secondary pollution.The BluAct All-in-one solution instantly filter out all the contaminants you could find in your tap water, from pesticides, passing through heavy metals to bacteria… everything is removed. How? With a four stages filtration cartridge: 1) a plant-based washable fabric take care of macroparticles and dust, 2) a coconut carbon block take care of your water taste, smell and microfiltration, 3) the BluAct patented granulated media with milk proteins remove the heavy metals and organic pollutants, and 4) a last stage hollow fibers take care of the microbiology of water.This is called the ultimate purification.Just filter what you need, when you need it. With the diverter valve attached to the faucet, you can choose when to filter water. Use clean filtered water to prepare your favorite drinks, from your coffee/tea in the morning to your detox waters to stay hydrate all day long. Don’t’ forget to use safe filtered water to rinse your veggies and fruits.  Wherever you live around the globe, connect BluAct countertop to your faucet and drink tap water safely.The Product is certified by the world health organization (WHO) under the household water treatment system (HWTS) scheme, at the NSF international laboratories in Michigan, USA, Swiss government and it is in compliance with food contact regulations. Single-use plastic water bottles are polluting our oceans, rivers, streets, landfills and poisoning our air when they're burned in incinerators.

                "Text": "My name is Filip, I’m founder and CEO of emood, whilst being a father and husband and until 2017 I had a regular job and life but just one day on my way to work I had a blackout and first epilepsy attack which meant being taken to hospital.  The outcome was that I have two brain tumors, one 4.5 cm in the front and the second 3cm in the 4 chamber in the place where all neurons are connected. Suddenly in that moment I was totally depressed and hopeless, but after a few days in hospital I started to change my thinking and decided to not give up, because my wife and daughter have nobody except me, and I still have to take care of them.\n\n                       In January 2018 I had my first of three surgeries, after being in hospital for three weeks and it was a very difficult and lonely time. ( even support of wife and daughter in this kind situations is challenging because I have to hide my emotions in front of them)The second and more dangerous brain surgery back in June 2019, again leaving my family for a few weeks in hospital meant I was alone ( alone with thoughts that I did not want to show to my family ) again and with feelings of fear, stress and not-knowing what would happen meant I was so scared for my life and what my family would go through.  The third surgery in January 2020 which then after battling a strong infection in the part of the skull and AGAIN weeks’ in hospital I kept getting knocked back down and feeling like my life was over and what else could possibly be next!Living with depression, and even when I knew that I still have my wife and daughter by my side who without them I wouldn’t have made it through.\n\n                       All the countless weeks in hospitals show me just how important is to be able to talk to someone, not only the people I know, but with anyone, meeting people on the ward, and expressing things that sometimes even the family may not have time to talk or would not understand would give me the release or a thought process I needed to go on and keep battling on for them.\n\n                       Of course I had my phone, but social media is not really the place where we can start conversations with strangers (who often judge on the basis of photos, videos) who use social media to share how glamorous our life is at a moment or a photo of a beautiful holiday in the sun.\n\n                       I wasn’t going to share or talk to someone about what I was going through as honestly nobody on those platforms cared and it wasn’t private enough as I didn’t want it shared around the world, I wasn’t looking for attention or likes... I just wanted to talk.\n\n                       So that is why the world needs emood. simply just to talk, no judgement or people sharing for likes or getting attention. It’s about connecting people so they are never alone if they have a phone, or not able to share what they feel with loved ones or friends as we don’t sometimes need their judgement.\nThis is how the idea for emood was born;\n                       2020 January - Beaumont hospital (emergency surgery - very bad infection)\n               After the evening meal, Nurse ( I do not even remember her name ) came to me ( she usually works in different ward but that day she was at St. Mary's ward - night shift) we talked for a while ( she was doing exams and bloods in the meantime)and she asked me \"do you have Netflix? - watch secrets. At the end she said goodnight and I have never seen her again.\n                       I watch \"Secret\" then research YouTube all night , I realize that lot of people live with this motto, and I knew that everything was going to be alright.\n                       I didn't have easy life but I always was want to do something good ( be remembered as someone how give a smile more than sadness, to help people around me, create opportunities for them and be happy with their success, smile and happiness.)\n                       But living on weekly basis with such a small chance to ( create something that can make dose dreams to come true)\n Secret \"law of attraction\" - I knew it all my life. But I really started to ( believe ) that day in the hospital.\n                       Believe mean - start to risk and take chances, not every time you will win but have to still believe and constantly think about life success for you, your family, friends and community. You will achieve what you want.\n                       This is how I understood the secret.\n       I start to think positively and really believe and visually that I still have an opportunity to make it happen. I knew that opportunity would come, I just needed to (catch) in the right time and take a chance. At this point I didn't even know what this could be.\n      One day at my regular daily walk ( rehabilitation) I start to feel very lonely and want to talk with someone who not know me, not judging me, \" just don't give a f..k \" and just talk, like in hospital where everyone is after a serious illness ( cancer, amputation) but when I was with these people we were not judged, not looking by our illness, nationality, gender, we just talked about different things and we were happy.\n                       I started to miss the hospital and this careless talk. because at home we haven't had a great situation since 2017 when I had my first epilepsy attack and in hospital I found that I have quite big 2 brain tumors.  I couldn't give up because I am responsible for my wife and daughter. But those 4 years were very hard. Even after those weeks in hospitals and 3 brain surgeries, and all other things happened through all this years, I am always trying to find good things in these moments and situations. Learn from those experiences and I know that all those things bring to this point.\n                       I am grateful for every good and hard moments in my life and especially the last 21y with my wife and daughter.\n                       That day February 2021, I started to think about mobile application where I can chat with people being absolutely anonymous, where I can just chat, not showing pictures what I eat or what I have - for all those things are different platforms.\n                       If I show my picture at present ( after surgery) I will be automatically treated more gently or arouse regret or at least I will think that way.\n                       So I wanted the place where I will only be held accountable for what I say from what I said.\n                       Where I can ask for objective feedback, where I can communicate in my native language, because not everyone speaks English.\n                       Where I can practice my language skills by talking with real people.\n                       Where I can meet people with the same interests and discuss ideas, change opinions.\n                       And where I can ask for help or help someone who is in difficult situation and not be afraid of own opinion as we all are the same and equal but everyone has own individual character ( personality ) and That's making us so special.\n                       So We invent emood application and create emood project, it's not only mobile application (communication tool) but also concept of emood nation where people can share their real emotions, worries, happiness, sadness. Because we all have a need to be connecting each other.\n                       Especially now when the situation around the world is like this with lockdowns and restrictions.\n                       More and more people are spending time on the Internet, but not everyone is ( brave enough to show himself in social media) - - or be afraid to be ( judging, hate).\n                       Even famous people sometime would like to hear real opinion about their new movie, song ,new restaurant, sport success or falling.\n                       I want to create community and brand which going to be ( synonymous to - careless and unafraid place to talk )\n                       Where you are not alone ever again.\n                       I decided to act, for a month I was doing market research, designing applications and functions that I would like to be available to everyone.    Having no financial resources to implement my project, I started looking for people with whom I could create emood.\n\n               Now we are a team ( more like family who take care for project as parent care about a baby) of 3 people with passion to do something good and positive, who spent 9 months making the emood app. \n      We believe the world needs emood.  Simply just to talk, no judgement or people sharing for likes or getting attention. It’s about connecting people so they are never alone if they have a phone, or not able to share what they feel with loved ones or friends as we don’t sometimes need their judgement.\n                       That's why we created the emood project.     Project because it is not just a communication platform that ensures anonymity.\n       Our goal is to create many additional projects based on the same assumptions.\n   We are currently working on the 2nd and 3rd version of the application, which will have additional features that will allow the user for many more interactions, while remaining anonymous. ( ready project waiting for implementation ) \n                       You also have a project to create games that will be based on the characters that represent emood.\n These are the principles that guided us in creating emood.1 . \"do not judge - do not hate\" Just Talk\n 2 . \"we are all equal and at the same time each of us is unique - each with its own personality and history\" Just Talk\n 3 . share only emotions, knowledge, experiences from life, joy in life, sadness that sometimes affects everyone.\n Because what is really valuable is what we have in our heads. And we can only share it with words. For this you do not need photos, videos, reality filters.\n                       When we use words, it is impossible to judge anyone in terms of - wealth or poverty, skin color, appearance, or anything that each of us tried to hide from others, even though others might not even see it.\n emood is not meant to be a competition for Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, but an alternative where you can talk carelessly without being exposed to everything you would like to avoid in social media.\n      Of course, we are cheering on all the social platforms that help to provide the wider community that uses the Internet \"smile, knowledge, hopes, views, everyday events\".\n                       Sometimes we just need to talk and that's why we don't compete, we only give the opportunity to contact all those who sometimes want to remain anonymous.\n                       We ourselves will use social platforms where we want to create a community that will support and share a smile. For this purpose, we have created 10 characters who have a personality like us. \n                       Anyone who wants to can identify with such a character.\n                       We are a small group of people who want to create something that we feel can help many people, especially nowadays. Now emood app v1 BETA is available on Play Store ( Android ) as we are doing last tests. emood app available for download on Play Store ( Android ) and App Store ( Ios ) version 1 on 29/10/2021      We want our application to always remain free, so if you use or just want to support the emood project, you can buy a product with our logo or donate via PayPal, swift or simply go to our (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok) give a like and share.Home website - https://emood.net/ Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/Emood.nation Instagram -  https://www.instagram.com/emood.connecting/ Twitter - https://twitter.com/emood75957557 TikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@emood.net?lang=enLinkedin - https://www.linkedin.com/company/emoodconnect/?viewAsMember=true  ",

                "Text": "MY WALK, is an electronic portable handheld device designed to encourage a walking style that achieves more benefits in less time than normal walking and engages more muscles, 90% as opposed to only 40% standard walk.MY WALK works in harmony with your body and smartly prompts you to excel intuitively.Think Nordic Walk, without the cumbersome poles.• The key MY WALK's effectiveness is it helps you to execute proper form more often than not, a full rep.• A walk is vastly improved to burn more calories and engage more muscles by encouraging the user to properly and fully elevate the forward swinging arm to a pre-determined level. Thus working not only the lower body but engaging the upper body torso, arms, back, neck, shoulders and hands.• When the forward arm reaches the pre-determined level an alert is emitted from the device, either flashing light, sound, vibration or a combination of these. Also the full rep is added to the counter so at the end of your walk workout you can see how many full reps for each arm.• The higher the elevation the faster a person will intuitively walk, propelling the user forward naturally and subconsciously. Pace and stride length instinctively increases also triggering proper/better posture, straight back, raised head. MY WALK works in harmony with the body and in sync with the user's ability.• MY WALK somewhat mimics Nordic Walking but surpasses it by having a greater range of elevation and ensuring the user is performing the forward arm swing to proper form and full rep.The benefits of walking are well proven, documented and accepted globally.Superboost your walk with MY WALK and gain more benefits, swiftly and easily.Low impact, easy to do, fun, suitable for everyone, only 10 – 30 minutes a day.You decide pace and place.Feel good, fit, trim, tone and healthier faster.After years of immense stress at work, an endless travel schedule to clients, meetings and trade-shows, and ignoring all the warning signs, my mind and body finally and severally showdown. My acute burnout happened in Australia, as far away from family and home as I could be. When I was finally discharged from hospital I made my way back home on mentally torturous long flights back to Sweden. Once home my doctor strongly recommended that I take up some form of regular exercise to aid my long road to recovery. In 2015 I took up walking after years of a sedentary lifestyle.  I am now 61 years old and have never been fitter in both mind and body, nor more toned, this I greatly attribute to the MY WALK device. The inspiration came to me on a regular walk around our local lake. After much R&D, prototype testing, first mould batch testing we now have 2000 pairs of MY WALK ready to full test the market. MY WALK was a major factor in my recovery and I hope that it will help others no matter what their motivation or goal is.MY WALK won two prestigious awards, one from ALMI and the other from Landstinget.1/ ALMI is a government organisation that assists entrepreneurs and local businesses through both financial and advisory support. ALMI helps with business development and encourages innovation. MY WALK won the ALMI award for innovation .2/ Landstinget is a regional council responsible for the Health, Care and Culture within their region. MY WALK won the award for innovation within healthcare.The money from both awards was used for further R&D and mould tool production.We are offering useful free gifts with some of our awards. Don't miss out, be quick and grab them.The double pocket expandable Sports Belt with reflective strips, useful for carrying your cellphone and keys while out doing your MY WALK Full Body Workout.

Each MY WALK device is driven by 2 x AAA batteries that powers the gyro-sensor, control panel, LED, speaker, rep counter and vibration motor. The gyro-sensor is programmed to the 3 exercise settings, moderate, brisk or intense. When the forward arm reaches the pre-determined level (exercise settings, moderate, brisk or intense), an alert is emitted from the device, either flashing light, sound, vibration or a combination of these. The full rep is added to the counter so at the end of your MY WALK Workout you can see how many full reps for each arm.

                "Text": "InstaCookCreated by TAK InnovationsThis Idea started 4 years ago when a friend of mine Dennis we were thinking what would be great to have in everyday life as neither of us have much time to cook, I first thought of a portable machine with an AA Battery 1.5 volts to heat up pre prepared meal then eat it, I tried it, it did not get far then I tried it with a 9 volt battery and a capacitor that almost worked but it was not enough power, I plan one day to head back to the 9 Volt design with capacitors or using a high amount of electricity from a small battery just like a camera flash for short term fast cooking.Anyway, I went through 4 years of building and failures I have tested over 5000 times with 3000 failures I would work a 10 hour shift and come home and do experiment after experiment for 8 hours each day until I found the magic combination to how it can heat so high for so long without having a massive battery. Its not the 9 Volts I wanted but it works perfectly.I honestly said this will take me 4-8 weeks at first it took almost 4 years of hell to create it so I am proud all that hard work paid off now I have the prototype hopefully it can be mass produced sold and help people all over the world have a hot meal with no kitchen needed.I was the designer engineer and the whole team only Llewyn from PRINT-3D.COM.AU Sydney he was amazing supportive and the only 3D designer that cared and put hard work in without breaking the bank as other 3D designers wanted an arm and leg I’m still in contact with him to this day.This all exhausted me and sent me broke and I used up all my money on parts batteries tools it was all made by me except the 3D plastic casing I designed it and had it built for the final prototype, I have a second earlier prototype it’s pretty ugly and crude but it works.I am currently broke and scraping through week to week to acheive my dream.The InstaCook business plans starts off with a great one-of-a-kind portable 5 side heating cook pot the base and 4 sides heat and cook evenly making a faster and better meal with the lid on it is a 6 sides spere heated capsule, patented portable battery powered cooker the battery can run from 10 min to 1 hour (standard battery runs 26 min) of cook time that can be taken everywhere like work, parks home, mobile homes, cars, camping, schools and for military use by soldiers, it is great for student or any anyone in a small living place or at work It does not just heat like a microwave it can heat or cook from scratch fast anywhere anytime, with no radiation.I am my own management, I have worked in many companies finance telecommunications, Beverage, technology and plenty more over the last 20 years, I have been inventions since I was 7 years old, My parents abused and tortured me for over 20 years they destroyed all my inventions and designed and did horrible things to me it took me a long time to get over the trauma and get back into my inventions, I want to build TAK innovations into a empire and I want to help all the people that need help and get them away from domestic violence and all forms of abuse so people can be the best people they can be without having to live in a hell or fear that they don’t know they can get away from, I don’t want to be rich and famous for the glory but I want to invent create and make this world a better place so people don’t have to live in fear and pain, inventing creating building and helping it is my love and passion and I now want to dedicate the rest of my life to, I have had a lot of business experience, my loves and engineering all science it is what I was born to do, I am my manager, inventor, designer builder, accountant and tech R&D.InstaCook solves the problem of trying to get through there busy days with having something as important as a hot meal without a kitchen, where they can take it and re heat or cook at their desk at work while working while others 20 people using the microwave, It will solve the problem of Uni student living in their small shared boarding house and being able to cook or heat in there room, it’s also great for people camping, picknick or militaryPeople who want to cook but don’t have a kitchen in there small living space.

                "Text": "7 generation of our injection molding machines. We have learned of our previous mistakes, our machines always have worked, but always there is room for improvements. In this generation we develop our machines to be more durable, with more pressure, increasing the speed of the process, making them easier to use. Use your free time, you can generate an extra income, identify a necessity develop something for that necessity, use our machine to manufacture it, and build a very lucrative business around plastic.Extended version.A 3D printer is mostly used to make prototypes. A manual plastic injection machine is made to make the parts in series. Don’t waste your money with failed 3D prints, expensive and delicate materials.A lot of people have the idea that a 3D printer is autonomous, but it is not, you have to make the file and send it to the printer (for each piece or set), you have to take off the pieces once they are ready if they have supports you have to trim them, you have to change the filament, and there are some common issues, jams, gaps, everything is delicate. If nothing goes wrong for example at the end of the day, you will have 10 pieces… with our machines 10 pieces is a matter of minutes, the same time you spend on the setup. Don’t use your 3D printer to do parts in series there is a better solution for that (our machines).Our machines are more than 40 times faster on average than a traditional 3D printer. The materials on average for our machines are 25 times cheaper. With a bigger variety. Lower power consumption. Power consumption is almost the same, but with our injection machines at the same time, you can make a lot more pieces, so the power consumption per piece is less with our machines.Better quality and presentation, less extra prosses. If for some reason one piece is damaged or without the quality or any error, you can easily recycle it, with our machines there is no waste.A 3D printer is by far noisier than our machines.What can I inject with these machines?Our injection machines are ideal to inject small plastic parts for many industries. Some products that you can inject are toys, kitchen accessories, pet toys, bathroom accessories, gears and mechanisms, accessories for phones, ornaments, make prototypes, mixing colors, and do plastic-color tests, self-defense products, sex toys, dental prosthesis, spare parts, automotive spares, complements for furniture, bicycle spares – parts, motorcycle spare – parts, fantasy jewelry, construction complements and more. What kinds of plastic can I use?You can use any plastic with a melting index above 12. You can find that index, in the datasheet of the plastic. You can use mainly: Polyethylene (LD - HD), Polypropylene, TPU, SBS, ABS, TR, Impact PS, crystal PS, PVC flexible, nylon, polyamides, compounds with fiberglass, and more. You can use almost every recycled plastic from injection parts, always do your tests first.What colors can I use?You can make any color you want. You can use masterbatch or dust pigment, each has advantages and disadvantages, masterbatch is slower but cleaner, dust pigments are faster to use but they are dirtier. when you change the color, the plastic will be mixed, so you have to waste some plastic, inject parts until the color is uniform. There are specialized purges to help to clean the machine, purges are useful to change color or the type of plastic.MoldsMolds are not included with any perk.The molds for a manual injection machine are by far cheaper than the molds for a hydraulic machine. Because the molds weigh less than a traditional mold, is easier to work with a small piece of metal. Molds can be easily done in a CNC machine, if you don’t have access to a CNC machine, we will implement a service for you, where you can send the file and we make the mold for you, and if you have a CNC machine we will sell blanks, pieces of metal that you can mill, to make your mold. How many pieces am I going to inject a day?Well first is a manual injection machine, it doesn’t work by itself, you can work 1 hour or 10 for example. Also, depending on the practice you have and the kind of plastic that you use. But the thing that influences the most is the size of the plastic part that you are going to inject. You can make 30,000 a day or 300.For example, in the video we inject 4 pieces every 3.5 minutes, more or less, without considering the first 15 minutes, to make it easier let’s say 4 minutes. If you work 8 hours and maintain that rhythm of injections, you can make 480 pieces, with a 3d printer that work will take you 320 hours or 40 days considering 8 hours a day (making one by one, if you make the maximum of the size of the bed it will take more time because the nozzle has to travel more) imagine that in the bed of the 3D printer can fit 10 pieces like the one that we injected on the video. Imagine that you are at ¾ of the work and it fails…you will lose a lot of time, and money. So, choose wisely, if you need to make plastic parts in series, with that number we can say that injecting a part is 40 times faster than 3d printing a part. Mold blanks.Is a piece of metal, with one face milled, in the other face you can mill the cavity that you want to make a useful mold. Mold blanks are made of a special alloy, zinc-based. This alloy is very used in the mold industry because leaves a metal without pores, and allows milling the mold easily (metal chips won’t stick to the endmill), with the necessary resistance, with a good cavity finish, and is easy to polish. we have many sizes available. With these blanks you forget the foundry process, you just place the blank in your CNC and mill the cavities of the mold.Test mold available as a complementIt’s a mold with 4 cavities, with this mold you can test different kinds of plastic, different temperatures and learn how to use the machine. The piece is a “padlock” for bags. You can add this complement to your existing pledge. One solution for your needs and budget. Our machines are ideal for: developers, engineers, Hobbyists, a plastic laboratory, small manufacturers, small workshops, entrepreneurs.Basic – Ideal for the ones how wants to have the first contact, with manual injection, great for small productions.Professional – Ideal for the ones how need more production and faster, bigger screen.Premium – Ideal for the ones how need bigger productions. More capacity. Tactile screen with different setups.Industrial - Ideal for the ones how wants to, the biggest capacity for an injection manual machine 180 cm3, reenforced materials, for harder work. Bigger mold holder. For bigger plastic parts that consume more plastic, with thicker walls more than 2.5mm.For years we have used the previous models of our machines, to make our products or more of our machines. With that base that we have from previous years… the mission was clear: better quality, make them more durable, improve the time that takes to inject a piece. It was a complicated mission but I guess it was accomplished. Everything was planned, tested, and modified until it works as planned. With time it may not look as new but it will still work fine.Machine Will be shipped disassembled, but you just have to plug the base and few screws... And it will be ready to inject. Shipping costs are for registered international mail. If you need FedEx, DHL, UPS, or faster service, please contact us. Machine package weights 9kg to 12kg.",

                "Text": "[ 🇩🇪 ↓ Für die deutsche Version bitte weiter nach unten scrollen ↓ 🇩🇪 ]Do-It-Yourself: Making your own organic oat flakes and muesli with the innovative electrical grain flaker from renewable resourcesThat is: 100% fresh and with all the valuable nutrients of the whole grain. With our new, stylish grain flaker, the electrical YouFlaker.the ingenious grain mill builder with 40 years of experience has developed the YouFlaker for us, together with designers from the Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences and the team that, years ago, developed the legendary Hawo's mills and most recently the Mockmill grain mills.offer various raw organic muesli base mixes and delicious toppings - and now finally a stylish flaker (grain flaker) for making a really healthy, fresh muesli breakfast yourself. It's quick and easy, at the push of a button!In order to be able to go into series production with the YouFlaker, we need your support. So far, there has been a fully functional, tried-and-tested model with all technical components in a 3D-printed housing. The next step is the transfer to series production, which incurs costs for the creation of the casting tools (for casting the housing from renewable raw materials, see below) and for setting up and scaling series production. With your contribution you help us pre-finance these costs.Note: The prototype is a bit top-heavy. This will be solved in the final version by adding two weights at the bottom.First, an analogy that most people will get immediately:Anyone who wants to drink good coffee rightly expects the coffee beans to be freshly ground, as the fresh processing simply makes the coffee taste better. The flavors come into their own. That is why coffee is freshly ground in every good café, and more and more people are grinding their own coffee at home as well.Exactly the same applies to muesli and cereals that are processed into flakes. The fresh aromas of the grain are retained in the best quality when prepared right before consumption. The flakes are significantly more absorbent when fresh and soften more quickly in liquid. In addition to the aromas - and this is in what it differs from coffee - when fresh oat flakes are squeezed, important nutrients are retained in the best quality as well. More on that now...So why squeeze oats into oatmeal yourself when you can buy oatmeal in any supermarket?! Hardly anyone knows: Industrially produced oat flakes are heated up to 100°C. First, the oats are treated with hot steam, then rolled and then dried again over high heat. This conserves the oat flakes for a very long time, but it also damages many nutrients, especially enzymes and B vitamins. We had this examined in the laboratory using the enzyme lipase. The lipase breaks down fats into their constituent parts. It is only thanks to this that the body can digest the fats contained in food and use its own fat reserves for energy production (source: NetDoktor.de). Enzymes are very sensitive to heat and are irreversibly destroyed at approx. 50°C. Fresh processing is therefore all the more important - without prior heating to preserve it. This is only possible with the YouFlaker!Enzyme activity of the enzyme lipase in nkat/gSome of the B vitamins are similarly sensitive to heat. We looked at vitamins B3 (niacin) and B6 (pyridoxine). Vitamin B3 is an important component of the coenzymes NAD and NADH, which help the body generate energy for metabolism. It is found in all living cells in the human body, especially in central organs such as the liver and kidneys and in fatty tissue. Vitamin B6 also plays a central role in metabolism. It is required by the body to convert and incorporate proteins, it contributes to the formation of neurotransmitters (messenger substances in the nerve cells) and has an effect on the immune system.B vitamins B3 and B6 in µgThese are the differences in quality that have been investigated so far. There are probably more, because oats contain numerous other enzymes and essential nutrients in addition to lipase. The point is: the freshness simply pays off! You notice this in the nutrients and, above all, in the taste. Many of our customers tell us that after having made their own flakes for the first time, they no longer want to eat the pre-processed oat flakes from the supermarket!This applies not only to oats, but of course to other types of grain such as spelt or rye, too. Fresh flakes simply taste better!The innovative material Arboblend® created by the Swabian company Tecnaro is used for the housing. It is a sustainable material made from 100% renewable raw materials, but it can be cast into a mold just as easily as a plastic. This means that large quantities can be produced cheaply and sustainably at the same time. Arboblend® is not only particularly sustainable, but is also has a significantly better visual and haptic appearance compared to conventional plastic. Lignins made from vegetable fibers are used to manufacture Arboblend®. These cause the plant cells to harden and thus ensure the strength of wood. Lignin is a \"waste product\" in the paper industry. Therefore, it is widely available in large quantities at low cost. The housing is basically made of wood, just poured into shape and without using additional wood. Innovative and resource-saving!You can easily remove the squeezing mechanism (with the two rollers) by removing the top cover and then pulling the squeezing mechanism out towards the front. Then you can dry clean it with either a paint brush or some other small brush (such as a toothbrush). The squeezing mechanism can also be cleaned under running water and with a drop of dishwashing detergent for thicker deposits.The electric DC motor has more than sufficient power to easily squeeze all types of grain (except corn - too big and too hard) as well as oil seeds such as flaxseed, sunflower seeds, hemp seeds or sesame. In this way, all muesli ingredients are freshly squeezed in no time.The squeezing process is relatively quiet. The two stainless steel rollers squeeze grain and seeds with playful ease. The engine hums quietly and pleasantly. Audible, but you can still chat comfortably next to it. For the techies among us: When squeezing, the volume is around 60 dB. That corresponds roughly to the volume when talking at low volume.With the YouFlaker you can produce 100 grams of fresh flakes per minute at the push of a button. It only takes half a minute for a 50 gram serving to turn whole oats (as well as other grains and seeds) into fresh oat flakes. Next, add one of our toppings and, if you like, fresh fruits and berries as well as (plant) milk - and the incomparably fresh muesli is ready!Before the prototype from the 3D printer and the finished series product came the design drafts on paper and on the computer...All photos are taken from the 3D printed prototype. In this case, the housing is still made of \"normal\" plastic, as only certain plastics can be used in 3D printing. The visual and haptic impression of the device will therefore change slightly. Arboblend looks a little less smooth than most other plastics, makes a high-quality impression and is pleasant to the touch.We will update you with photos of the finished series product once they are available...(only available for European customers due to import restrictions)We have developed our muesli base with raw organic grain to match the fresh processing with the YouFlaker. You can also add these as a sample package (size M or size L). In combination with the YouFlaker, you can get our sample kit at a particularly affordable price - with a discount of around 10 euros. So you can start flaking right away! It's worth it!For our organic muesli base, we only use raw and organic cereals (naked oats, spelt, buckwheat) and seeds (linseed, sunflower seeds, sesame), which must be squeezed with a grain flaker before consumption in order to produce cereal flakes and to squeeze the seeds (particularly important with flaxseed!).We only use organic naked oats as oats, as they are particularly rich in nutrients. In contrast to ordinary (husk) oats, they do not need to be heated in order to remove the husk, which saves the enzymes, vitamins and fiber it contains. By the way, because of the naked oats, we also do all these silly word games with Nackte Tatsachen (The Bare Facts) and Naked Brunch...Nackte Tatsachen (The Bare Facts)Content: 500 gIngredients: naked oats*, flax seeds*, sunflower seeds** From organic farmingDE-ÖKO-039 Naked BrunchContent M: 500 gIngredients: naked oats*, spelt*, flax seeds*, sesame** From organic farmingDE-ÖKO-039Buch ohne Weizen (Buck-no-wheat)Content M: 500 gIngredients: buckwheat*, flax seeds*, sunflower seeds** From organic farmingDE-ÖKO-039Average nutritional values per 100 gWe have developed three toppings with freeze-dried fruits and berries and a few other ingredients, such as raw cocoa nibs, with which the muesli can be easily garnished.

Mit der neuen stylischen Flockenquetsche, dem elektrischen YouFlaker.der geniale Getreidemühlenbauer mit 40 Jahren Erfahrung, hat für uns den YouFlaker entwickelt, zusammen mit Designern der Fachhochschule Darmstadt und dem Team, das vor vielen Jahren schon die legendären Hawo's Mühlen und zuletzt die Mockmill Getreidemühlen entwickelt hat.bieten verschiedene Müsli-Basis-Mischungen und leckere Toppings an – und jetzt endlich auch einen stylischen Flocker (Flockenquetsche) zum Selbermachen eines wirklich gesunden, frischen Müsli-Frühstücks. Es geht schnell und ganz einfach, auf Knopfdruck!Um mit dem YouFlaker in Serie gehen zu können, brauchen wir Eure Unterstützung. Bisher gibt es ein voll funktionsfähiges, erprobtes Modell mit allen technischen Komponenten, in einem Gehäuse aus dem 3D-Drucker. Der nächste Schritt ist die Überführung in die Serienproduktion, bei der Kosten für die Erstellung der Gusswerkzeuge (zum Gießen des Gehäuses aus nachwachsenden Rohstoffen, siehe unten) und den Aufbau und die Skalierung der Serienproduktion anfallen. Du hilfst uns mit deinem Beitrag, diese Kosten vorzufinanzieren.Anmerkung: Der Prototyp ist noch etwas kopflastig. Dies wird im Serienprodukt behoben sein durch zwei Gewichte im Fuß.Zuerst eine Analogie, die den meisten direkt einleuchtet:Wer guten Kaffee trinken will, erwartet zu Recht, dass die Kaffeebohnen frisch gemahlen werden, da die frische Verarbeitung den Kaffee einfach besser schmecken lässt. Die Aromen kommen besser zur Geltung. Daher wird Kaffee in jedem guten Café frisch gemahlen und auch privat mahlen immer mehr Menschen ihren Kaffee selber.Genau das Gleiche gilt bei Müsli und bei Getreide, die zu Flocken verarbeitet werden. Die Frischearomen des Getreides bleiben bei Zubereitung direkt vor dem Verzehr in bester Qualität erhalten. Die Flocken sind im frischen Zustand deutlich saugfähiger und werden in Flüssigkeit schneller weich. Zusätzlich zu den Geschmacksaromen - und hier liegt ein Unterschied zum Kaffee - bleiben beim frischen Quetschen von Haferflocken außerdem wichtige Nährstoffe in bester Qualität erhalten. Dazu nun mehr...Wieso also überhaupt Hafer selber zu Haferflocken quetschen, wenn man doch auch Haferflocken in jedem Supermarkt kaufen kann?! Was kaum jemand weiß: Industriell hergestellte Haferflocken werden auf  bis zu 100°C erhitzt. Zuerst wird der Hafer mit heißem Wasserdampf  behandelt, dann gewalzt und anschließend bei starker Hitze wieder  getrocknet (gedarrt). Das macht die Haferflocken zwar sehr lange haltbar, aber beschädigt eben auch viele Nährstoffe, vor allem Enzyme und B-Vitamine. Wir haben das anhand des Enzyms Lipase im Labor untersuchen lassen. Die Lipase zerlegt Fette in Ihre Bestandteile. Nur dank ihr kann der Körper in der Nahrung erhaltene Fette verdauen sowie eigene Fettreserven zur Energiegewinnung verwenden (Quelle: NetDoktor.de). Enzyme sind sehr hitzeempfindlich und werden schon ab ca. 50°C irreversibel zerstört. Umso wichtiger ist also die frische Verarbeitung - ohne Erhitzung zur Haltbarmachung. Das gelingt nur mit dem YouFlaker!Enzymaktivität des Enzyms Lipase in nkat/gÄhnlich hitzeempfindlich sind einige der B-Vitamine. Angeschaut haben wir uns die Vitamine B3 (Niacin) und B6 (Pyridoxin). Vitamin B3 ist ein wichtiger Bestandteil der Co-Enzyme NAD und NADH, die dem Körper helfen, Energie für den Stoffwechsel zu gewinnen. Es findet sich in sämtlichen lebenden Zellen des menschlichen Körpers, vor allem in zentralen Organen wie Leber und Nieren und im Fettgewebe. Vitamin B6 spielt ebenfalls eine zentrale Rolle im Stoffwechsel. Es wird vom Körper benötigt, um Eiweiße umzuwandeln und einzubauen, trägt zur Bildung von Neurotransmittern (Botenstoffen in den Nervenzellen) bei und wirkt sich auf das Immunsystem aus.B-Vitamine B3 und B6 in µgDas sind die Qualitätsunterschiede, die bereits untersucht worden sind. Vermutlich gibt es noch weitere, denn im Hafer sind neben der Lipase zahlreiche andere Enzyme und Vitalstoffe enthalten. Der Punkt ist: Die Frische macht sich einfach bezahlt! Das merkt man bei den Nährstoffen und vor allem aber auch beim Geschmack. Viele unserer Kunden berichten uns, dass sie nach dem ersten Mal Selberflocken die fertigen Haferflocken aus dem Supermarkt gar nicht mehr essen möchten!Das betrifft außerdem nicht nur Hafer, sondern natürlich auch andere Getreidearten wie etwa Dinkel oder Roggen. Frische Flocken schmecken einfach besser!Für das Gehäuse wird das innovative Material Arboblend® der schwäbischen Firma Tecnaro genutzt. Es handelt sich dabei um ein nachhaltiges Material aus 100% nachwachsenden Rohstoffen, das jedoch genauso einfach wie ein Kunststoff in Form gegossen werden kann. Dadurch können günstig und trotzdem nachhaltig auch große Mengen produziert werden. Arboblend® ist nicht nur besonders nachhaltig, sondern ist auch von der optischen wie haptischen Anmutung deutlich hochwertiger als Kunststoff. Zur Herstellung von Arboblend® werden die Lignine aus Pflanzenfasern verwendet. Diese bewirken die Verholzung (Lignifizierung) der Pflanzenzellen, sorgen also für die Festigkeit von Holz. Lignin fällt in der Papierindustrie als \"Abfallprodukt\" an. Daher steht es ohne weiteren Aufwand kostengünstig in großer Menge zur Verfügung. Das Gehäuse besteht also aus Holz, nur eben in Form gegossen und ohne dass dafür zusätzliches Holz verbraucht wird. Innovativ und ressourcenschonend!Du kannst das Quetschwerk (mit den beiden Walzen) einfach entnehmen, indem du die obere Abdeckung mit einem Handgriff entfernst und das Quetschwerk anschließend nach vorne herausziehst. Dann kannst du es entweder mit einem Pinsel oder einer kleinen Bürste (zum Beispiel einer Zahnbürste) trocken reinigen. Bei stärkeren Ablagerungen lässt sich das Quetschwerk auch nass unter fließendem Wasser und mit Spülmittel reinigen.Der Elektromotor hat mehr als genügend Power um spielerisch sämtliche Getreidearten (außer Mais - zu groß und zu hart) und Ölsaaten wie etwa Leinsamen, Sonnenblumenkernen, Hanfsamen oder Sesam zu quetschen. So werden alle Müslizutaten im Nu frisch gequetscht.Das Quetschen geschieht relativ leise. Mit spielerischer Leichtigkeit quetschen die beiden Edelstahlwalzen Getreide und Saaten. Der Motor summt leise und angenehm. Hörbar, aber man kann sich daneben bequem unterhalten. Für die Kenner: Beim Quetschen liegt die Lautstärke in etwa bei 60 dB. Das entspricht in etwa der Lautstärke beim normalen Sprechen in Zimmerlautstärke.Mit dem YouFlaker stellst du auf Knopfdruck 100 Gramm frische Flocken pro Minute her. Pro Portion mit 50 Gramm dauert es also nur eine halbe Minute bis aus dem ganzen Haferkorn frische Haferflocken geworden sind. Dann noch eines unserer Toppings und je nach Belieben frische Früchte und Beeren sowie (Pflanzen)milch dazugeben - fertig ist das unvergleichlich frische Müsli.Vor dem Prototypen aus dem 3D-Drucker und dem fertigen Serienprodukt standen natürlich die Design-Entwürfe auf Papier und am Computer...Alle Fotos sind vom 3D-gedruckten Prototypen gemacht worden. Bei diesem besteht das Gehäuse noch aus \"normalem\" Kunststoff, da nur bestimmte Kunststoffe beim 3D-Druck genutzt werden können. Der optische wie haptische Eindruck des Geräts wird sich also nochmal geringfügig verändern. Arboblend wirkt etwas weniger glatt als die meisten anderen Kunststoffe, macht einen hochwertigen Eindruck und hat eine angenehme Haptik.Wir werden Bilder vom fertigen Serienprodukt hinzufügen, sobald diese verfügbar sind...(wegen Importrestriktionen nur für europäische Kunden erhältlich)Passend zur frischen Verarbeitung mit dem YouFlaker haben wir unsere Müsli Basis mit naturbelassenem Bio Getreide entwickelt. Diese können von dir zusätzlich als Probierpaket (Größe M oder Größe L) hinzugefügt werden. In Kombination mit dem YouFlaker bekommst du unser Probierpaket natürlich besonders günstig - mit rund 10 Euro Preisnachlass. So kannst du direkt losflocken! Es lohnt sich!Wir verwenden für unsere Bio Müsli Basis ausschließlich rohe und biologische Getreide (Nackthafer, Dinkel, Buchweizen) und Saaten (Leinsamen, Sonnenblumenkerne, Sesam), die vor dem Verzehr mit einer Flockenquetsche gequetscht werden müssen, um daraus Getreideflocken herzustellen bzw. die Saaten zu quetschen und somit aufzuschließen (ganz wichtig bei Leinsamen!).NackthaferWir verwenden als Hafer ausschließlich Bio Nackthafer, da dieser besonders nährstoffreich ist.

                "Text": "I'm a passionate developer and I needed a place to host my own applications, a mail server, my website and so on. I wanted full control, so I decided to rent a server, where I could just do all I wanted.However, in my time managing my own server I came across a few recurring problems:Now, this was some time ago, and I decided to switch to another server provider. This opens another problem, as there is no way to simply copy and paste my configuration of one server to another. I definitely am not the only one, so if you're experiencing any of the problems above, I have the solution for you.Yes, nothing of this is groundbreaking new technology, however it's about combining it all together into an actually useful and most importantly easy to use tool.The solution is to use a combination of git and Docker. Most people reading this far probably know of at least the basic concept of both, but for the remaining ones, here's a little explanation.Git is simply a way of saving all changes ever made to files in a directory (called a repository in this case). It's basically like taking snapshots of all the files, and later being able to view or restore any snapshot. Furthermore, it's possible to sync those snapshots to a server, where they can be read from again with any other computer. If we now can compress all configuration of the entire server in one directory we already have two of the problems taken care of: #1 Remembering old settings and #4 Simple transfer of configuration.Docker offers a great way to run applications completely independently of each other, solving problem #2 Compatibility between applications. The core concept is similar to a virtual machine, however Docker comes with far less overhead and more performance. And, to complement the first point, there is a way of specifying which applications to run in a text-based form.This only leaves problem #3 Quick and easy updates. The basic concept is to store the entire configuration of your server in an online git repository, like GitHub. To set up your server, all you'd have to do is manually run one single command, that would boot up a docker container setting up everything. The container would pull the configuration form the repository and launch all specified applications. Those should contain at the very minimum a service that can be used to replicate updates from the repository.GitHub offers a useful feature called Webhooks; when an updated \"snapshot\" is pushed to the repository, it will send a request out to a specified URL. This URL would then be handled by said  \"update\"-service, pulling the updated configuration and deploying it.Open-Source:I'm planning to have every aspect of this project Open Source and available under the GPL v3.0 license, which basically grants everyone the right to use the code for whatever purpose, as long as they keep the source open, use the same license and show a copyright notice.Modular:Every part of the software that I can reasonably publish as an individual package, I will. This will enable enable anyone to build on which ever part I develop.Isolated:My personal aim for this project is not only to solve the above mentioned problems, but also to not touch or rely on the host-system at all. Ideally everything is running in containers and no modifications to the server itself are needed, except for installing Docker. Uninstalling Docker would result in a clean slate, with no relics at all.Progress:You can find all progress, as it happens on my GitHub-Account. More detailed information on the progress and technical details can also be found down below.The basic project will very likely come together, whether this project is successfully funded or not, just because I personally want to use it.The Kickstarter has the main purpose of gauging the interest in this project and by this potentially funding additional goals:1. Improving the quality:Funds will be used to further the development, testing, documentation, etc. of the project, to turn it from a niche-hobby project into more of a fully fledged solution.2. Add-ons:I have some ideas for potential add-ons, that I'd develop only, if there is enough interest. Anyone can suggest add-ons; I will all consider all input I get. As a thank you to higher-pledging supporters, their suggestions will be considered first and might have a lot more influence on the final shape of the project.3. My own hosting service:Should there be that much interest, that it seems like a feasible option, I will actually take this from a hobby to a professional level, register a company, do whatever is necessary, to create my very own server provider, providing not only servers for rent, with this software pre-installed, but also host a custom repository server, so that all necessary infrastructure would come from one hand. You still would be able to just install the software on any other server, it's just less convenient.If you want to see this happen, please share this Kickstarter with anyone that might be interested. I can't afford ads or paying an agency for this project, so it really is up to you to get the stone rolling.This list is neither final, nor exhaustive, nor guaranteed. It serves as inspiration, which features could be implemented with enough funding.The barebones for this project have already been implemented:As of the writing of this, already a basic system has been created, that can be updated only by pushing to a GitHub repository. It features nginx in the form of openresty as a proxy and supports forwarding subdomains to individual Docker containers.To see the exact current state of development, see the GitHub repositories.The core config can be found here.To see an up-to-date example of a repository used to configure the deployment, see this  GitHub repository. This I me using GitDeploy for my own server.Also, a simple monitoring dashboard for Docker is in the works:Basic research for the hosting service has begun:A list of all the small packages that were developed in the context of this project, but can be used on their own. This list will be updated as soon as something new is available.Node.jsDocker",

                "Text": " All of the objects around us are filled with Printed Circuit Boards (PCB). But you mostly never seen them, since they are boxed inside the device.But why, though? When you look at them closely, you can fall in love with their beauty: structured, complex, stuffed with components... For many of us, as children, they looked like small futuristic city models!Of course, their purpose is not to be pretty. Yet, when you take the time to design one, you can easily add drawings and, if you are creative enough, make it a piece of art!That was the clever idea of Léo Giroud, Master student in physics. He likes to prototype and play with PCBs, and wants to bring them in your keychain, on your bags and clothes! Our goal is to create an online shop to sell our PCBs. They are decorative gadgets, to be used as pins, keychains, necklace, etc. They exists in two flavours:For this campain, we've made a dozen of early designs. A very small quantity is already available in our Etsy shop. This campain will allow us to fund a first stock of these PCB and to develop our online shop. So that we would be able to work on new designs freely!After sketching the PCB, we make the PCB design out of it on a special computer software. This process is technical and requires basic knowledge in electronics.When the PCB is ready, we order all of them to our manufacturer that will create the PCB for us. This process can be long as two weeks, depending on the amount and colors of the PCBs. When we receive them, we have to prepare them: soldering all the components for the luminescents ones mostly. After this, they are ready to be shipped to you!The project is held by a single person: Léo G. (it's me!)I am 22, currently a master student in physics. But it seems that I have lots of other interests, such as DIY crafts, electronics, and -of course- PCBs!I am in charge of the realisation of the designs, the creation of the PCB and all of the soldering stuff. I will most likely remain the only working individual in this project!In a close future I hope to be helped for graphish and communication by my friend, Gabriela P. This project would not have existed without her.Our estimation is currently at 2500€ for three main things:If we reach our goal, the leftovers will be used for the creation of an official business!You just have to order the first counterpart and choose the PCB that you would like to have in the add-ons. Also, for counterparts higher than 15€, you will receive a \"thank you\" special campain PCB where your nickname will be displayed on it (if you want to)!Feel free to check out our Etsy shop! before the campain end, to see all the designs available in details. Also check our Instagram, our  Facebook or our  Twitter!Your support for our project is vital and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Your help is the key to make this project reality.

                "Text": "Have you ever felt bored or tired looking at string lights? This is because normal string lights have a simple and systemic pattern that splits the bulbs into two groups that flash alternatively.Can you feel the difference between the two videos below?Both show trees decorated with string lights of 200 light bulbs. Conventional string lights splits up the flicker of its lights so that 100 turn on when the other 100 are off. Then they just interchange the state of being on and off.lumi.art, on the other hand, is a state-of-the-art string lights that embeds a semiconductor chip in each LED, allowing move independently and control the mood to your liking through mobile app. If you take a moment, you’ll see that none of them blink at the same time.Users can even create their own patterns and sequences in the app. See them appear on lumi.art in real time.The smartphone app supports both iOS and Android and can be downloaded for free from the App Store or Play Store.Using the app, you can not only edit real-time patterns, but also edit, save, and share sequences, and schedule operation times.Use lumi.art in various moods and places or as part of your own arts and craft. We leave it up to you to get creative!None of the lights blink the same way. They flicker independently and randomly. Then by editing the frequency and brightness through the app, users can create their own patterns and sequences. It’s almost like you can create your own set of beautiful stars in the night sky. How is this twinkling possible?By embedding semiconductor chips in all LEDs, it creates a twinkle pattern that make each of them blink individually. This simply cannot be imitated by string lights out there today. It’s a patented technology that we’re proud to hold.We provide 8 pre-set light patterns for a variety of moods with lumi.art. You can also create your own patterns with your smartphone app.The example video below show a combination of 400 steady lights and 200 LEDs lumi.art on a Christmas tree.Example pattern - 1 : Energetic nightThis pattern resembles a dynamic atmosphere that matches the energetic music of the club with quick-blinking LEDs.Example pattern - 2 : Pouring starsThis pattern resembles twinkling stars in a quiet night sky with select LEDs that fade out while most stay on.Example pattern - 3 : Mellow fogThis pattern embodies the image of emerging water mist by dimming up and down the LEDs one at a time.Example pattern - 4 : Roaring bonfireThis pattern creates the feeling of a crackling bonfire by having the LEDs flicker off very quickly and turn back on.Example pattern - 5 : Hopeful waitingThis pattern gives a comfortable yet slightly urgent feeling by gently turning the LED on and off, so we named it \"Hopeful waiting\".Example pattern - 6 : Nostalgic loveThe slow frequency at which the LEDs fade in and out conveys reminiscent feelings of a long-past lover.Example pattern - 7 : Flourishing desireThis pattern is named \"flourishing desire\" because like our aspirations in life, the LEDs are quick to grow and spread.Example pattern - 8 : Fading memoriesUnlike the pattern right before, LEDs in \"Fading memories\" turn on slowly and turn off quickly, reminding us that even the fondest of memories don't last forever.A natural tendency of the human brain is to find patterns and stability in everything we do. This is instinctive because we require natural regularities like knowing that the sun will rise every day and lions going out to hunt in order to survive. Predictability is great but it requires our brain to process a heavy amount of visual information, often causing overload and burn-out.On the other hand, when you see random movements of nature, such as sparks fluttering in the fireplace, leaves swaying in the wind, or waves glistening in the sunlight, you feel at peace and relaxed.This is because the brain gives up trying to find regularity in such movements and accepts the beauty of nature. lumi.art has 8 blinking patterns built-in, so the default patterns are automatically operated at default intervals without connecting to the app.  Also, the USB type transmitter has a button, which can be pressed to manually switch the pattern.If you connect with the app and send a pattern or sequence edited in the app, it will work with that thereafter.In addition to reinventing the versatility and beauty of string lights, lumi.art is challenging many other aspects of the existing string lights.Believe it or not, the idea behind lumi.art goes back 30 years. Looking at the string lights I always see around Christmas season, I kept thinking that the blinking pattern was too monotonous and mechanical. I thought, “how amazing would it be to have all the bulbs twinkle individually?” And that’s how lumi.art was born.The problem was that when the idea was implemented, the product was too expensive. However, due to the rapid progress of semiconductor technology in recent years, the price has come down to a level that can be commercialized. With more affordable semiconductors, we were able to apply for a patent five years ago and refine our technology ever since.As for next steps, I want lumi.art to completely change the way we see and use string lights. The twinkle pattern of string lights has stayed the same for the past 100 years. I think it’s finally time to challenge that – from mechanical and monotonous light patterns to a true source of art.As the most trusted product launch company in the world, Enventys Partners has helped launch over 2,000 innovations with global sales of over $1 Billion dollars for our clients.By utilizing 20 years of experience in:Got an idea? We would love to help you launch it.",

I was born and raised in Azerbaijan where I have started my career in marketing communications at Omnicom media group. I moved to Spain to pursue my MBA together with my 3 years old daughter, and after graduation, I joined a company in Madrid and have been consulting tech startups for 2 years. During that time I was actively using dating apps. That's when I started to notice how dating apps made me feel. First, of all, they consumed my time, I had to swipe and talk to several people at once for getting one date. And then once I went on a date I found out that people either don't look or behave the same way. And my time was wasted, my self-confidence was weakening with every date. I have met some nice people who later became my friends, but I could not meet anyone with whom I could be aligned. And I realized that the only dating app that I would use is the one that can help me to meet with real people around in a live mode, while I do what I enjoy, without going on pre-arranged dates or spending hours looking on my screen. That's how Blink was born. Blink allows users to present in the same venue to match, chat, play games, and meet instantly. With a special feature, you can select the place to go or tag yourself in your favorite spot and see who is around. If you find your perfect match, agree to meet instantly and have a chat. We want to eliminate time and energy wasted on dating apps and give our users an opportunity to experience live encounters. our app is not niche, it's inclusive as it does not depend on your sexual preferences, which you can easily filter, it depends on your lifestyle and places you like to attend. And our goal is to offer a completely new experience, not engage users with the app. We will be happy if users leave the app for a good reason. We have already finalized the MVP and we want to develop app further, add new features and have a marketing budget to promote the app. Even if you can't contribute to the funding, we would be happy to see you on our waiting list.",

You just need to put your plant under Octopus and turn it on. Thanks to the Wi-Fi connectivity, you can set up your Octopus very quickly and easily. With the help of an integrated camera and e-mail application, you can observe your plants from wherever you are located. Thus, your plants will never wilt and the progress will always be under your control. Features of OctopusFeatures you can find only in OctopusOctopus is a smart Grow Led System  (GLS) that has many new features that are being introduced to the grow-led industry by the Octopus Team. What you can grow with OctopusWith Octopus, you can grow various plants at home.  Below are a few examples:   How you can grow with OctopusWith Octopus, you can grow almost any plant in your home, from seed to full harvest. In this section, you will find a brief introduction to how you can do this. A more detailed guide will be provided with the product.Main Components of OctopusDevelopment of OctopusThe spectrum of the light that is needed by plants is called Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) and the shape of this spectrum is of great importance for the grow light design. The design of Octopus is based on studies to understand the Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) spectrum. With the design of  Octopus, we have made several simulations to test and determine the optimum LED arrangement for the generation of the PAR. The Octopus Technology Team has designed hardware and firmware/software components to maximize the user-friendliness functions. Integration of these components has developed two prototypes of Octopus. Design IterationsEven though many iterations have been tried at the components level during the design of Octopus,  Octopus has only two prototypes. The necessary modifications have been done on the first prototype to improve the power supply and the Wi-Fi module of Octopus. Moreover, a cover has also been designed and integrated into Octopus to enhance its appearance. The below pictures show the prototypes and modifications.LED Board DesignThe LED board is one of the main components of the Octopus. It is supporting and feeding the LEDs, which produce light for the plants. Below you can see the prototypes of the LED board on which the Octopus Team has conducted some tests and made modifications.Tests of OctopusVarious tests have been conducted on Octopus. Some of the performed tests are explained under the following topics.Illumination Performance TestOctopus can generate up to  70000 lux at a distance of 30 cm at 110 watts of input power. This value is twice the amount that direct sunlight gives and seven times the amount of full daylight (not direct sunlight). Please see the table below for illuminance from various sources.The video shows the maximum illuminance from Octopus at a distance of 30 cm at steady-state. Light meter showing the illuminance in Lux - the actual value is 100 times the displayed value for the selected range. The test box is covered by Mylar reflective film.Light Stability TestThe stability of light is very important for the plants to grow undisturbed under Octopus. The video shows the stability of Octopus is stabile even if  the input power is fluctuating.Wattmeter showing the instantaneous AC input power in Watts to the Octopus.Manual Dimming TestThis video shows how Octopus adjusts the input power and in turn, the level of light by the “Dimming” button.  Automatic Dimming and Energy Saving TestAutomatic dimming is a new feature introduced by Octopus to grow light technology. The feature will help to save energy while eliminating any disturbance to the growing plants.In the video below, you will see a 1500 Lux external light source that is used to test the automatic dimming feature of Octopus.  The sensor threshold is set to 1000 Lux. Octopus dims the light automatically as the external light source approaches the sensor.Maximum PowerOctopus can go up to a maximum of 110 watts.User Safety We have also tested the safety of Octopus. The below video and image show the output voltage of Octopus stays below 50 V. This is accepted as an extra-low voltage and low-risk source by the safety authorities (src: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_voltage).  Octopus has also many other safety functions to protect the user and device itself.

With buru-buru, every handwash becomes a fun, engaging experience.Buru-buru's ample bubble clouds offer much better coverage over palms and backs of hands - approximately about 3x more surface area coverage than your average soap dispenser.Based on testing estimates, Buru-buru uses only about half the soap required per effective hand wash as compared to conventional soap dispensers!To refill, simply pop off the lid, remove the screw cap, and pour in your favourite foaming handsoap!Buru-buru is compatible with most foaming hand soaps, and has been tested with soaps from the sample brands above. Non-foaming hand soaps also work with a 1:1 water to soap dilution ratio!  Buru-buru’s pledges do not include shipping costs. We will be using Easyship's post-campaign backer management platform to manage and charge shipping before sending out the Buru-buru orders. We will strive to offer the best, optimised shipping costs for each country based on our shipping partner estimates.Hello there! Buru-buru is run by a team of 3 passionate industrial designers. It is a labour of love and toil - and countless hours of playing with bubbles. Our adventure began in August 2021, when the three of us sat down to talk about a possible Kickstarter project. We found that we had something truly special in the idea of applying bubbles - otherwise novel, ethereal, fun playthings - to practical contexts and use cases. Buru-buru was born - a dream to create a soap dispenser that could turn any ordinary handsoap into bubbles instantly. After hundreds of hours of design work, one too many cups of coffee, and approximately 98430 popped bubbles later (we didn't actually count), we are on the cusp of launching buru-buru on Kickstarter!​Help us make Buru-buru a reality, and make hand washing something magical that kids can look forward to. ✨​❤️ Follow us on Instagram! ❤️ Check out our cool website! With love, and lots of bubbles,-- Team buru-buru",

Fundamentally, the real value of learning is the direct, relevant and positive impact on one's life - beyond who delivers it.  Please click on the link to get the slide deck on About Loolla.Loolla started out as a project by a dad wanting to better help the learning of his young school-going children.  Whilst social messaging platforms are now commonly used these days to aid in learning, they can be disruptive, disorganised and inadvertently divert the focus away from the learning process itself.   He simply wanted to create a better option - beyond the disruptive messaging platforms - for his young schooling children to safely connect with the online learning community; to learn from those who know or have-been there and to share their knowledge and abilities with the world when they are ready for it.Online learning is more than just watching fancy videos, consuming interactive content or obtaining online badges and certificates.  Be it about solving a maths problem from school, working on a group assignment, performing a task, picking up a new hobby or building a skillset; many of us - young and old -  inevitably depend on a network of people who provide useful guidance and wisdom that support our learning and discovery. Without this network, it can be difficult sometimes to locate, reach, sieve through and understand the information, answers and guidance we seek. Your learning network is the multiplier that amplifies your learning.  Whilst there are many messaging platforms out there for communication and exchanges, and a multitude of online learning courses, one is hard press to find a tool that can easily build and grow an individual's personal learning network to support learning and discovery over time. A personal learning network (or PLN, in short) is a dedicated space, where one can easily initiate, participate in and spread learning of ideas, knowledge, skills, wisdom, experience, tools and tips.With Loolla, you can easily build, grow and develop your personal learning network - with relevant people, on different subject matters, at your own time and in your own pace.  Loolla brings together the useful features of communication technologies that allow online group formation, interactions and sharing, with the power of learning management systems that allow you to create, publish and sell online courses.  With Loolla you can :Carry your personal learning network with you, always.  Accessible via desktop and mobile devices, you carry your personal learning network all the time with Loolla.

Sports and music were the only level of success those around me knew of that seemed realistically achievable. It's like adversity was a part of the lease agreement in most of our neighborhoods.  Despite the disadvantages I managed to pick up the one thing I felt to be a quick fix to distract me from all of life struggles. Although I\"m convinced it was nothing more than a distraction.This addiction led me to play middle, high school, and college basketball. Throughout my college journey I've always had the idea of doing something big. I wanted to showcase my creativity, but also set the tone thinking outside the box. I fell in love with technology as I became obsessed with reaching my goal. I planned to write a book but I said to myself, how valuable would I be if I gave people something they could start and finish? So I decided to deliver who I am as a creator in a way that could live forever. It may seem complicated but overall I'm just a kid from a small town Kinston, NC. The youngest of 6 siblings and always felt the coolest no matter who I was around or where I was at. For some odd reason I began networking in college expanding the idea of who I wanted to become. Today I am presenting everyone with Cool People Network. My Blog was designed to present education over entertainment because I wanted to change the narrative. Anything is possible if you surround yourself with right people and change your mindset when it comes to success. If this campaign isn't backed 100 % I still wanted to say I appreciate the opportunity to even share my story and idea amongst so of the worlds coolest creators and supporters. ",

The accuracy is comparable, and at times better than traditional methods, and because it's AutoML (i.e., automatic machine learning), you don't need a data scientist to run it -Anyone can use it, since it's point-and-click software, that runs on its own.This will save companies enormous sums of money, as they no longer need to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars per year paying data scientists to solve routine problems in deep learning, since they can instead have relatively untrained employees use my software, which will in some cases cost just a few dollars per month.The reason this pricing works is because I already wrote the software, and stand to profit more from making my software cheap, and widely used, rather than expensive, and limited to enterprise clients.In addition to saving enterprise clients money, it would also allow anyone with demand for deep learning, from restaurants and hospitals to entrepreneurs, to make use of what would otherwise be prohibitively expensive software. The goal now is to create two versions of the software for sale on the Apple App Store, which will require rewriting the software in Mac's Swift Language.I've already started this process, and a very basic version of the prediction software is already complete in Swift, with more obviously to come.Funding is needed to cover the costs of registering with the app store, creating a professional website, a professional email account, and personal daily expenses until the software is commercially available.",

                "Text": "Booka Local Language barrier app between foreigners and Native German speakers and Pro Bono Services to international visitors who are sexually assaulted in Germany.Hi, I'm Mei Chi Lo, the creator of the Booka Local app, knows all too well the challenges non-German speakers face when navigating various processes. I was sexually assaulted in Germany and found it difficult to file a report due to language barriers. I got the support needed through the help of my German fiancé that bridges the language barrier.  I also faced other daily challenges as a non-native German speaker living in the country, such as speaking to customer service representatives. Thus, I got a challenging spirit to put these traumatic and frustrating experiences to work for a positive cause—creating a service that connects people looking for help navigating language barriers with local helpers who speak the language and understand German bureaucracy.Booka Local website was launched in November 2020 in Germany. Via the site, international visitors and immigrants who may not speak German proficiently can request assistance with various tasks that may require translation. Some services that helpers can provide are making phone calls with utility companies, scheduling appointments, and filling out bureaucratic paperwork such as visa applications. The site has gained traction and overwhelmingly positive reviews since its launch nearly a year ago. Because of Booka Local’s popularity, the team is now focusing on launching and marketing its app, giving users access to local language helpers at the tip of their fingers.Completing tasks that require communication can be difficult and frustrating for millions of people living in and visiting countries where they may not speak the local language proficiently. Booka Local, a new translation services app available in Germany, is looking to give non-native German speakers a way to break through language barriers by connecting them with locals who speak German. Once connected to a language helper, the user can get the translation assistance needed to complete a wide variety of tasks that otherwise may be difficult due to limited language skills.Booka Local users pay an hourly fee to their helpers for assistance via the platform. But one selling point of the app is that the rates offered by Booka Local helpers are far less than those of professional translators. The Booka Local team also takes great care to ensure the safety of their customers by screening the local helpers carefully before making their services available on the platform. And for those looking to be helpers, the team also takes utmost care in ensuring their personal safety and that their feedback is heard and taken into consideration. All the local helpers are insured by Booka Local.“In creating Booka Local, I wanted to deliver something impactful that would ensure that international visitors or immigrants with limited German language skills could avoid the frustrations and embarrassments I experienced in trying to navigate everyday life and government bureaucracies.I wanted to be sure that no other sexual assault survivors have to experience roadblocks with navigating bureaucratic and legal processes because of language barriers. That’s why Booka Local offers pro-bono services to international visitors who are sexually assaulted in Germany. They can now secure the needed translation support to file the appropriate reports. We help the victims navigate the language-related procedures such as filing a police report, for free.As it takes time to learn a foreign language, we step in and provide those having troubles with the German language by providing language-related services like attending appointments, phone calls, or even document checking.One of our main goals is to help internationals integrate within German society. That is why we have also been working on producing an ebook with questions we asked the locals. We plan to distribute these to the internationals for free so that they have a better idea of how the locals think or what they would normally do in certain situations. We want to break the stereotypes internationals might have about the Germans and the German culture.My team has dedicated our services to a good cause in bridging the language barriers but we need to improve this app usage because, what is worth doing, is worth doing well. Help us achieve the best version of Booka local and Pro-bono services.Thank you",

                "Text": "Nade nació por un sentimiento que todos hemos sentido e algún momento de nuestras vidas... La soledad.Mi nombre es Juan y soy de Cantabria, España. Hace dos años, tras pasar por un momento complicado en mi vida, y con ese sentimiento de soledad a flor de piel, surgió una idea que se apoderó de mí: La soledad es algo que todos hemos sufrido alguna vez de una forma o de otra, y con todos los medios de los que hoy en día disponemos, el sentimiento de soledad es cada vez mayor en la sociedad actual.Por ello me aventuré a crear Nade, una red social en la que los usuarios pueden hablar sobre sus inquietudas, sus problemas, sus experiencias... Un lugar donde encontrar a gente que les entienda y que les pueda ayudar, al igual que ellos podrán ayudar a otros.El lema de Nade es \"Todos tenemos algo que contar\", y es precísamente porque todos tenemos nuestras experiencias, vivencias, conocimientos... Y por eso cada uno de nosotros puede aportar algo a alguien en un momento dado, como también le puede aportar algo otra persona en otro momento. Y gracias a la tecnología, esa persona puede estar en tu misma calle, en tu misma ciudad, o al otro lado del océano.El objetivo de Nade es crear una comunidad en la que los usuarios sientan que no están solos, que los problemas que ellos tienen, los tienen otras personas o los han tenido en algún momento de sus vidas. Que tengan la tranquilidad de saber que hay un lugar donde se pueden desahogar, donde pueden preguntar esas cosas que a veces no se atreven, y donde pueden ayudar a otras personas, porque la sensación que te da haber ayudado a alguien es de completa plenitud, y es algo que muchas veces olvidamos y que nos llena por completo.Por otra parte, el proyecto ya está lanzado desde hace unos 4 meses. Hay más de 4.000 usuarios entre España y los países hispanohablantes, y el feedback que recibimos es en su gran mayoría muy positivo. Mucha gente afirma que es una App necesaria.El proyecto ha supuesto cerca de 100.000€ de inversión, todo ello ha sido abordado con presupuesto personal, que fue invertido en el desarrollo de la App y de la web, y en la elaboración de planes de marketing y ventas.Los fondos recaudados serán empleados en algunas ampliaciones en el desarrollo (20% de los fondos aprox.) con el fin de mejorar la App, en un plan de marketing y ventas (60% de los fondos aprox.) con el fin de dar a conocer Nade y comenzar con la facturación, y en gastos generales (20% de los fondos aprox.) como pueden ser el mantenimiento del servidor, las tarifas mensuales, los gastos en material, personal...Esta es nuestra página web: www.nadeapp.com , en ella presentamos Nade, explicamos su funcionamiento, y desde ella se puede acceder a descargar la App en diferentes plataformas, o a acceder a la versión web de la App.",

Those dogs were loved once, but some of their owners didn’t know how to prevent the behavioral issues that made life unbearable for both of them. Even though training is essential for having a happy pet-owning family, many owners cannot find the time or support for the training their dog needs.That’s why we made the Sniffy App: to help create a loving companion not a statistic. You get clear guidance and personalized support you need in training, right on your phone.A Revolution in Dog TrainingThe Sniffy app puts a professional dog trainer in your pocket.

That’s why Sniffy lets you create a customizable plan where you choose the training topics that fit your dog and interest you most instead of forcing you into one general training plan.Dogs are smart and can learn more than one thing at a time. You can help your dog become a happy and polite pup with our core training topics including “Basic Manners,” “Polite Walking,” “Reliable Recall,” etc. We also have content for basic management of behaviors like barking and jumping. Sniffy includes special topics such as “Puppy's First Lessons” for new puppy owners and “Enrichment” for owners who have energetic dogs that need more exercise as well. We provide you with the essentials no matter where your new buddy comes from and what age they are.Not sure what skills to learn and practice in your training session? Wondering how often and how long you should practice to achieve your goals? Do you know what to do if your dog doesn’t learn as fast as the dog in the video? Sniffy has got you covered.Training definitely takes time, and you need to be consistent for the best results. With Sniffy, you can easily plan your daily training session based on our suggestions, your dog’s performance and progress, or your interest and time. We help you establish a routine and achieve your end goal progressively. When things don’t work out right away, you can always refer to the \"Not Working?\" section in the app.Your training session is made up of watching video tutorials and practicing with your dog. Each tutorial includes a video as well as written instructions. Each of them is designed to teach you how to take baby steps toward success. Nothing more, nothing less. Our trainers and dogs will guide you through your plan and keep you motivated with their energy and demonstrated accomplishments. You will see the science behind positive reinforcement training instead of punishment, and learn how to apply these techniques yourself.

We'd really appreciate it!It started with one stray catOne day in December of 2014, what started as an average day for me, was horrible for ZaiZai. The first time I laid eyes on my cat, he had just been run over by a car. Seeing him struggle to the median with his front paws dragging his bloody back legs behind him, I stood shocked by the fight in him. I decided I would take care of him until his last day.As much as I saved ZaiZai that day, over time he saved me by shining a light on my future. After years of not knowing my purpose, taking care of him made me realize what I wanted was simply to help create better relationships between humans and animals. I wanted all animals, not just humans, to live with dignity and receive better care. ZaiZai inspired me to leverage the power of technology to improve pet care.With this goal in mind, I came to the U.S. to pursue a master’s degree in Human-Computer Interaction at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). There I met my best friend, Ting. We worked together well on school projects and got good grades, but my heavy workload of school projects never got in the way of my ultimate dream.My first idea of serving pets through technology was to build an app to make dog walking more fun. I knew that while at least two dog walks a day are important for dogs, many owners don’t make the time simply because of boredom. So I asked Ting to join me in developing an app that would motivate owners to walk their dogs. We named it Sniffy.After interviewing 100 dog owners we learned that people would rather focus on their dog than an app while going for a walk together, and many of them mentioned behavioral issues that got in the way of enjoying that time and others. We pivoted our idea of a dog walking app into a dog training app. To turn the idea into a real product so it could benefit the most dogs and their families, we took programming and business classes, participated in student accelerators, and interviewed another 300 dog owners and trainers to investigate the current issues with dog training. We found that although many owners know their dogs need training, professional dog training resources are not easy to get. We knew an app could be the answer.We found certified trainers who were passionate about this project and willing to collaborate with us. We made some training videos teaching dogs basic manners, built the beta app, and tested with 50 owners. 39 of them paid for our future product.Our videos were highly applauded for helping dogs learn basic skills. Nearly 60% of testers had tried group training before but found they didn’t work because of distraction in class and both them and their dogs forgetting what to practice afterward. This is where Sniffy shines. Video tutorials show owners exactly what to do anytime and anywhere, and helpful reminders make training more consistent. Our testers saw their dogs’ progress and were very satisfied with the beta app.Sniffy is Proven and Will Get Even BetterPositive feedback from early customers shows that Sniffy has the potential to shape more dogs into adored family members and enrich more owners' lives at the same time. Now our ultimate goal is to provide a platform that integrates training, pet care services, healthcare, nutrition, and other offerings into one streamlined service. We believe a system like this can reduce behavioral issues and pet abandonment and create happier pet-owning families. This is what drives us.You can learn more about us at https://www.sniffy-app.com/about",

                "Text": "It all started when, after a trivial purchase, we wondered if our choice had really been the most sustainable for the climate.  We tried to find an answer but we realized that it is practically impossible in a reasonable time.Therefore PARADIGMA #Pcool was born, the climate sustainability indicator that translates complex information into a visual message of immediate understanding.HOW IT WORKSThe Paradigma indicator is based on the method of calculating greenhouse gas emissions recognized by the international scientific community:GHG ProtocolIt makes it possible to quantify the greenhouse gases emitted by them throughout their value chain.This method identifies 3  emission areas:Scope 1: Direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by it (use of fuels);Scope 2: Indirect emissions from the purchase of electricity, steam, heat;Scope 3: All remaining indirect emissions in the value chain (extraction and production of purchased materials and fuels, emissions from business travel, transport of products and material, waste disposal).This data is made public by companies that have implemented a monitoring system of their greenhouse gas emissions. They are usually found in the annual sustainability reports that companies share with their stakeholders.Sharing all this information is NOT MANDATORY.But even if these data are made public, it is not always easy to compare them.Following the principle of the International Standard, the GRI 305 PARADIGMA makes the comparison simple and understandable to everyone!For more details visit the official website  on the site you can also see a demonstration page of the operation.ROAD MAPStep 1: from idea to product! \n In this phase we intend to collect the resources to develop the service and consolidate the partnerships.

Solitamente si trovano nei report annuali di sostenibilità che le aziende condividono con i propri stakeholder. La condivisione di tutte queste informazioni NON è OBBLIGATORIA. Ma anche se questi dati sono resi pubblici non è sempre semplice il loro confronto.Seguendo il principio dello Standard internazionale il GRI 305 PARADIGMA rende il confronto semplice e comprensibile a tutti!Per maggiori dettagli visita il sito ufficiale sul sito potrai anche vedere una pagina dimostrativa del funzionamento.ROAD MAPFase 1:da idea a prodotto!\n      In questa fase si intende raccogliere le risorse per sviluppare il servizio e consolidare le partnership.

                "Text": "Over 85 million Americans use electric/battery-powered razors, and the US market size for razors is up to 4 billion dollars. These numbers are reflected as people started to gain interest in taking care of their outer looks, accelerating the growth of the men's grooming market. This phenomenon will grow the demands for shaving products and the whole men's grooming market in general. And the beauty industry, like these, will focus more on the detailing section of men's beauty. Amongst all the possible products, nose hair trimming is one of them.People seldomly use nose hair trimmers instead of using their hands, scissors, or wax to take care of their nose hair. But they do not seem to satisfy the user's expectations most of the time. Instead of actually trimming your nose hair, plucking is not going to fill your needs anymore. And nonetheless, plucking your nose hair is very dangerous.There may be times where the sharp blades might poke and scratch the inside of your nose. Experts warn the public that nose hair plucking is quite dangerous. The assistant professor for ENT at the Columbia University Medical Center, Jason A Moche, stated that since the human nose sucks in dust every day in a vacuum, plucking one's nose hair might put the individual at risk of infection.An individual might look very appealing Just by keeping yourself clean and calm. With M-9's light, portable, simple, and curvy dome-shaped design, users are free from the threat of hurting themselves due to the absence of a mirror. The world's first ergonomically designed dome-shaped design will keep you safe and slick. Meet the innovative nose hair trimmer M-9 that will make you the gentlemen you dream of.ㅤ ㅤWe all have hurt the inside of our nose trying to pluck out our nose hair with sharp scissors or tweezers.  But they do not really get the job done and hurt our nose badly.The M-9 was designed with ergonomics and safety in mind with its dome-shaped structure, making the blades invisible externally. With its soft curved line finish, the users will not feel uncomfortable, and they will also be free from the threats of a sharp blade. Also, by coating the dome-shaped nets with nickel, it is upgraded to ensure our user's safety and sanitation.The dome-shaped structure brings another level of safety by preventing the blades from making direct contact with any parts of our body. Also, since it was designed with a dome shape, it prevents the users from accidentally sticking the device deeply inside their noses. (Providing a more comfortable shaving/trimming experience)The dome-shaped heads and their blades provide a super high precision cutting, drastically decreasing the chances of pinching or scratching the skin. Also, since it is made with stainless steel, the M-9 is extraordinarily durable and economical, with no need for frequent replacements to be made.When removing nose hair, the highest priority is how fast and precisely you can remove them.The M-9 is upgraded with the 8700 RPM motor from the 7100 RPM Motor from M-7(our previous model). With this upgrade, the M-9 is equipped with the most powerful motor, providing a more delicate and precise trimming with a high-speed centrifugal cut.M-9 is only 12.5X2.5X2.5cm and 54g big. Due to its lightweight and size that would perfectly fit in our palms, the M-9 is way lighter than other electric shavers. The M-9 also comes with its own carrying case, enabling users to carry it around to keep their fresh looks.Also, there is no need for extra charging. A AA battery is good enough to provide power for prolong usage. It will take care of your hair with just a touch of a buttonGrooming is needed for every part of your body. The M-9's usage is not only limited to nose hair but, it can also be used for ears, mustache, eyebrows, and sideburns. If you have that cool mustache then, design it with more precision. They can all be done without expert help if you have M-9.As this is a product that is inserted in our nose, we took extra precautions on sanitation. The M-9 is splash-proof, and it can be cleaned by just rinsing it with water. After shaving, just simply insert the head of the device, and it will clean automatically.If you would like to really deep clean your M-9, use the cleaning brush provided with the package. Now, you are ready to keep your blades clean and sanitary, 24/7.Unlike other ordinary nose hair trimmers that are just round in shape, the M-9 is round with straight and edged lines. These were done to provide a better grip with an ergonomic design. With this unique design, the M-9 will not roll over your countertop. (Or it can even be kept standing up)By selecting non-glare black plastic, the M-9 has a modern and minimalistic look. The M-9 is the ultimately designed shaver for you.* Warning: When rinsing the device after disassembling the dome-head, be cautious as the blade might slip out.With our experience and technology in developing beauty appliances, we developed our own nose hair trimmer. We did not settle on just a single development, but we came up with a much safer and sanitary nose hair trimmer based on our customer's feedback and technological improvements.TR lifestyle. Inc is a beauty appliance brand with 60 years of experience and technology. To provide our products with more safety and bring them up to perfection, we are only manufacturing our products by hand.

                "Title": "Regenerated TB47 and TB48 batteries",
                "Text": "Back when released in 2014, the Inspire 1 was the first professional drone that allowed many more people to enter the UAV world for aerial photography and video shooting, without requiring high level skills on electronics and informatics that were the key for professional aircrafts at the time: it did just work.Countless camera operators and directors based their fleet on this powerful machinery, leveraging the ecosystem of gimbaled cameras, lenses and accessories that offered great versatility at a reasonable cost.In our company we still use and fly the Inspire 1 regularly as today, and we believe that’s still one of the most utilised drone worldwide; the reliability of this platform compared to its successor is drastically higher, and in a world of continuos, poorly-tested software updates, the fact that for years there were no more firmware upgrades is almost reassuring. Funny, isn't it?Unfortunately, DJI decided to forget this entire platform in favour of it's successor, the inspire 2, and with this, discontinue essential spare parts as the TB47 and TB48 batteries.This leds to the grounding of thousands of perfectly working drones, and all the money invested in this ecosystems by many businesses around the globe is flushed down the toilet with themAlso, in this era of environmental awareness, where everything needs to be rethinked to cope with sustainability needs, it is not acceptable to throw in the trash such good electronic parts, generating more unnecessary e-waste.Hating this unbelievable situation, we decided to research and work on regenerating the precious batteries on our own.As designers and manufacturers of electronic devices for a while, we went throught the rabbit hole of figuring out what is rotting badly in old batteries, why they stop working, perform poorely or even swell up.Inside a TB47, TB48 and in general any other smart lithium battery you see around you, there is a big pack of lithium cells, and an electronic BMS that manages charging, discharging, balancing, temperature control and charge level.The part that usually wears out with time and use is the cell pack; just replace it and... well, no.First of all, the cells used in drones are very high performance, as they need to pack an enormous amount of energy in a very confined space, and operate over a very wide temperature window.Then they are not in standard sizes, in fact standards don't even apply to lithium packs; we would need a custom made cell pack, assembled with custom made cells. Costly.And finally, when this is sorted out, you need to please the small little brain that is inside the BMS, as he remembers the old, worn out cells; you need to introduce him his new partner, the new pack that is now as powerful as the original one he was shipped out with.You'd reckon all of this requires a non-trivial amount of research and development, some guesswork and a crazy amount of testing, in order to ensure everything is working and the various parts are playing nicely together.And don't forget, even opening up these batteries is not a simple job, unless you want to end up with broken clips or warped plastics.... we did it!We figured out the BMS.We designed the cells to fit into the casing.We streamlined the production workflow.And we are starting to manufacture the cells! And this is also where the fun ends.We do need to set up a production run for several hundreds of batteries, as we now manufacture the cells manually, which costs us a lot in terms of labour and materials.TB47 line is already up and running, and it costed A LOT. But at least, we can regenerate your batteries right now!We also managed to gather a decent amount of old TB47 and regenerate them, so if you want to purchase them, we have them in stock!But for TB48, we cannot sustain the hand-crafting of cells anymore; the other parts of the regeneration process, which include opening, disassembly, cleaning, testing and reassembly, are still necessarily performed by our skilled operators, but at least the cell production needs to be automated.Ours is a small company, but the KopterMax brand is quite well known in the drone industry; we've been the first manufacturing carbon fiber folding propellers for the Inspire 1 and 2, and the production is still active, with requests from customers happening regularly.When we started regenerating the first batteries, the news run fast, and we have been contacted from all over the world.Of course this has spurred us to create a product with an aesthetic appearance that lives up to expectations, but most importantly, with a very high reliability; we decided to offer a warranty of 6 months or 200 charging cycles, exactly the same as the original manufacturer provided.We are taking care of the entire regeneration process here at the KopterMax HQ in Sankt Mortiz, Switzerland, to ensure that such a delicate and dangerous product is assembled in the safest and most accurate way.Your help will ensure we can start a full production run for the cells, optimising cost and material waste, and guaranteeing a still long life to the Inspire 1 drone family!For each battery you will send in for regeneration, we will discount 20€ (TB47) or 30€(TB48) from the listing price; you can also directly buy regenerated TB47, as we have plenty of stock; TB48 will need to wait for the new cells production run, but every purchase of TB47 will also contribute to the funding!Shipping is calculated separately, but we encourage combining inbound and outbound shipments with your friends or colleagues to save on the cost.Contact us at battery@heliengadin.com for more information about shipping and handling.",

It has waterproof, anti-fouling, wind-proof, anti-knife cut, storage bag, face mask, luminous, and good-design as well.Wesmart is the world's first All-Weather Smart jacket. You can wear it to ski in the cold Alps, enjoy the sunshine in Hawaii, get out and explore the Amazon jungle, or as a daily streetwear.                                                                  TravelLiquid nitrogen, at -196℃, can instantly cause frostbite on the skin. With its outstanding cryogenic insulation performance and internal heating system, Wesmart passes the liquid nitrogen insulation test, making it a suitable layer for protection from the most extreme cold.In the past, if you were in the weather of -100°F, you needed to wear something as thick as a bear.Other heated garments leave you feeling too hot or too cold with non-adjustable temperatures. Wesmart adjusts accurately with the App to the perfect temperature that suits any situation.Open the app and preheat your jacket to make it warm before you wear it.100℉-150℉ intelligent heating, support manual and APP two modes.Wesmart is equipped with 4 built-in carbon fiber heating panels. Within 3 seconds, the heaters will begin to warm the jacket and its integrated graphene system will distribute the heat to your body instantly.Graphene is an excellent conductor of heat. It moves heat through its latticed structure, evenly distributing it around your body. In warm weather, it expels heat and wicks away moisture to keep you cool.Wesmart uses a combination of 3 layers of technical fabrics, the first layer is a durable Polyester Fiberc, and the middle layer is a nano-film. Its density is smaller than water molecules and larger than air. It is waterproof and can achieve good breathability. The third layer is graphene, which provides extreme durability and heat conductivity.Wesmart is powered by an external power pack via a USB cable located inside the side pocket. We use the fast-charging battery for the power bank with 6.5V output, it increases 60% of the heating speed when it's under -10°C.Wesmart perfectly combines technology and fashion to create the most futuristic high-performance clothing, providing users with an unprecedented new experience. The essence of science and technology is to serve people. Wesmart follows this principle and explores the relationship between clothing and body to establish a brand-new balance-sensory technology that is applied to all-weather travel, skin sensation, and sports experiences. Our designs create a new layer of intelligent technology for human beings.",

With a 3D-printed resin lightweight handle that feels like it was made to be held by you, meanwhile, the handles look elegant and can be customized by yourself with your own 3D printer. X-ONE puts the power of every shave into your hands – with a DIY razor that you can assemble yourself and make your own.Most conventional razors on the market today are built using aluminum alloy, and one of the biggest problems with that is that it’s exceptionally uncomfortable to use in winter. It’s heavy, it’s cold, it’s simply unpleasant. And you deserve better.We’re boldly steppe into your bathroom and transforming your shaving routine once and for all, with an advanced shaving innovation built from photosensitive resin. A hollow design is light in your hands, empowering you to groom and pamper in innovative style.We know we said it already, but we can’t reiterate it enough. You cannot truly comprehend the comfort and power of a photosensitive resin razor (built using the latest HALS polymer technology, which has peculiarity of high toughness and hardness) until you’ve put it to the test yourself. And once you have, you’ll never go back.While most conventional razors are heavy and leave you with itchy, unsightly razor burn, X-ONE features a ground-breaking 6-layer precision blade, leveraging advanced Sandvik technology produced in the heart of sweden. In fact, men just like you have confirmed with this razor can and will last 3 times longer than regular blades. A worthy investment? We think so!Each tri-blade set contains two blades a piece, with a fine 0.85 mm distance between each blade and 1.4 mm distance between each set – guaranteeing the most efficient and effective shave of your life.Every sweep of this bad boy feels like it was designed for your face. Everyone is unique, which is why we’ve designed X-ONE’s head to be 30°+10°. In other words: while the handle is fixed to 30°,the ergonomic head can be adjusted by 10° depending on the shape and different parts of your face. This promises a unique and cleanest shaving experience you will not find anywhere else.X-ONE packs in one hell of a punch for such a light razor. Its hollow design is based on humankind’s natural grippe style, making it more comfortable and natural to use without feeling heavy in your hands.X-ONE will never slip and slide around when smothered in shaving foam. A comfortable yet firm grip keeps your razor right where it’s supposed to be – firmly in your grasp.Don’t know where to store your razor in-between shaves? Neither did we. Conquer the chaos in your bathroom with a magnetic handle and stand that keeps your X-ONE safely stored for next time while ensuring efficient water drainage that prevents bacterial growth. With advanced magnetic storage like this, you’ll never be fumbling around to find your razor again. Perfect for those busy mornings when you need to clean up – fast. Moreover, any steel shelves can also be used to store the X-ONE, no matter standing or simply hang on it. In this way, the head will be even more hygiene.Cleaning X-ONE takes only a few seconds, so you can get on with your day. A quick rinse will remove any stains and germs in a flash, all thanks to its special array of blades.There’s no need to buy a whole new razor if your current head is worse for wear. Simply pop it out in a snap with one single press, and replace it in moments. We recommend doing so every two month.X-ONE puts you in control of every shave. With a 3D-printed handle and all the data included, you can customize your style, color, and look and feel if you have your own 3D printer. We share all data for the head and connector so you can do your thing, and the material is compatible with most other materials on the market – from liquid photosensitive resin to ABS resin and beyond.(After the project is over, users who purchase X-ONE will contact us to provide the tracking number to obtain the print data of the X-ONE handle. You can also contact us by email: jiapeng.yu@ubunnys.com, we will provide you with after-sales and answers)X-ONE’s data is compatible with 99% of FDM 3D printers out there – including creality  3D, Aurora 3D, and Raise 3D.X-one 3D printing razor uses the innovative new material plasto 1000, a resin with high elongation and excellent flexibility, and has special treatment on the surface.

                "Text": "The current pandemic has taught us that something as simple as measuring our body temperature can tell us a lot about what condition our body is in. Even the slightest changes in our temperature can allow us to make informed choices such as whether we have to socially distance.  Although we may not need a thermometer everywhere we go, do you readily have access to one when you need it?  With the HIITCHECK, you only need 1 second. We understand that speed may not be a priority for most cases, but if an emergency arises, HIITCHECK will be there to give you the information you need as fast as possible. HiiTCHECK focused on development for two years to resolve consumers' distrust of existing non-contact thermometers especially when it comes to temperature measurement accuracy.Research and development was carried out to obtain a high-accuracy body temperature value by blocking the product's own heat and readings of non-relevant external temperature. Finally, after three rounds of product development, we were able to create the perfect infrared sensor that drastically minimized the margin of error. Now, we would like to present this technology to our Kickstarter backers before we fully release this to the general public. Most consumer-grade thermometers have large margins of error because they do not take into consideration the specific emissivity value of human skin. Therefore, accuracy of results will vary when using a single generic device to measure the temperature of variety of things.   HIITCHECK has maximized its accuracy and minimized the margin of error by developing a measurement algorithm that specifically takes human skin emissivity into account while measuring body temperature.The blackbody is  high-precision calibrator for the calibration of infrared thermometers. For the verification of medical thermometers, the temperature must be verified by a blackbody. ADDPLUS has received certification for the HIITCHECK through this method. Time of Flight Distance Sensor – The high-precision laser distance sensor will begin measuring the body temperature of a person once it is positioned within 3~5cms (1.2 ~ 1.9 inches) away from the skin. When the temperature sensor is out of range, HIITCHECK will send an alarm via vibration to notify the user to move closer or further away.THE FDA recommends when using non-contact infrared thermometers to measure either the forehead, temples, or behind the ears. HIITCHECK should not be used to measure body temperature via wrist readings, but if necessary, should be used on blood-flowing arteries.HiiTCHECK APP INCLUDED Did you know that everyone has a different average body temperature?With the HiiTCHECK thermometer, you can check the trend of your body temperature, and analyze the patterns to proactively maintain a healthy condition.Up to 5 guardians can automatically receive and share the records of one HiiTCHECK user. The HiiTCHECK app can also connect to Google Maps so that you can find the nearest hospitals and pharmacies.*All information stored through the HiiTCHECK app is available only to you.  Temperature management’ is the due diligence that we must all take when it comes to basic self care. The HiiTCHECK thermometer & app provides services that can be valuable to many different types of people. You can select and use the functions that are most convenient and suitable to your needs. Ex: Men who want a feature that automatically records their body temperature. Women who want to check their ovulation cycle. Young adults in their 20s and 30s who are active in staying up to date about their health condition during global health crises\n HIITCHECK is about the size of an Apple Air pods case and has been intentionally designed to be small so that you can take it on the go or place it in areas that will make it readily accessible to you at any point in time.HIITCHECK can be extremely handy on trips that may put a lot of stress on your body. We recommend taking the HIITCHECK with you when traveling, camping, or going on overnight business trips.Simply attach it to the back of your smartphone and use it as a cradle or carry it with you in case your condition happens to deteriorate while you’re away from home. HIITCHECK can be plugged in to your smartphone via a USB-C. Your phone will act as the power supply and automatically turn on the thermometer for immediate use.Since the HIITCHECK uses a USB-C, our thermometer may not work with certain Apple devices since they may use a lightning cable. Apple devices also require a separate (Made For iPhone) certification which we currently do not have.1. HiiT CHECK Thermometer Body2. Ring-type Holder & Case3. Sticker For Smartphone Attachment x24.

                "Title": "Peterest: The World's 1st No-Power Scoop-Free Cat Litter Box",
                "Text": "Love your cat, but hate the unpleasant routine - scooping? If you use a traditional cat litter box, you need to scoop at least once a day, and probably replace the plastic litter box itself at least once a year or wash the box thoroughly with detergent. And then on top of that there’s the unavoidable dust, litter scattered everywhere, and smelly odor all the time.You could go for a fully-automatic cat litter box, but those have to be placed close to the power supply, the noise of the machine may frighten your cat, and what’s worse, you’d be surprised at how many cats are actually die from mechanical failure of those fully-automatic litter boxes. Yikes! Luckily, Peterest has none of these problems and is here to save the day!Pull the handle, the rake will slide to scoop the waste into the waste receptacle beneath. Out of sight, out of smell.Whether it’s little poops or clumps of pee, the Peterest effortlessly scoops it with it’s proprietary scooping systems, so you don’t have to! No more scooping by hand.Peterest works with any kind of clumping litters such as clay litter, crystal litter, and more.With the Peterest, the smells and odors of your cat box are significantly reduced. You can place the box right in your front room and still not smell it because the smelly clumps are quickly scooped into a sealed container that keeps odor trapped.The extra-large waste bin allows up to 7 days free of scooping for one cat​. Moreover, Peterest offers a spacious interior with the capacity for cats of all weights and ages.The best thing about Peterest is the whole process is contact free. All wastes and odors are segregated within the small container, so you don’t have to touch it or scoop it out yourself.We use innovative material BDPET for the container. This material can be degraded in a shorter time than traditional PET(polyethylene terephthalate) and has been certified to ASTM D5511. When buried deep in soil, the container can be degraded to 7.71% in 45 days, and could be completely degraded in more than one year.Everything you hated about scooping and cleaning has been fixed with Peterest!The litter box is deep enough so the waste doesn’t stick to the bottom and there’s plenty of room for your cat to maneuver around inside and do their business.Equipped with a enclosed design, Peterest can keep the litter inside, reduce litter loss and contain the odor. Along with a replaceable charcoal filter, the odor control system is reinforced and your cat is more pleasant to use the litter box.The rake combs through the litter removing all the clumps but still leaving the litter behind and raises to 3.5 inch to leak the litter. That means your litter lasts longer because you’re not scooping all of it out with the poop and pee!The rake can be detached easily and cleaned thoroughly. It doesn’t hold any odors or get stained in any way. Just a quick spray off with some water and it’s completely clean and ready for action.Easily remove the top and dispose of the waste bin whenever you feel the need, and when you put every part back together, it keeps all the odors nicely contained in a mostly sealed environment. Besides, the detached bottom can be used as an open litter box and stacked for convenient transportation.Peterest tells you when it’s time to scoop. The short plastic pole will pop up when your cat enters the box automatically. Then, you know it’s time to scoop. You can press the pole back down after you’ve completed the job to reset it.When it comes to litter boxes, electric (or fully-automatic) sounds good, but there are actually quite a few drawbacks.It doesn’t matter if your cat is big or small, Peterest is a great litter box where it can easily fit and do it’s business without any troubles. Even if your cat is Savannah, Maine Coon or Highlander, it can stay in the box comfortably.There is a transparent front window so you can always keep an eye on what’s going on and see the level of the cat litter. But the other walls are not transparent so your cat can feel safe while it goes to the bathroom and also has some privacy.One of the worst things about typical litter boxes is all the litter that gets scattered around the box. With Peterest, there is a built-in litter trap under the swinging door that catches most of the litter from your cat’s paw as they exit the box. That way the area around your litter box stays clean, and your cat isn’t tracking litter all around the house.Start your effortless cat litter scooping journey, and enjoy a happy life with your lovely kitty.Most people like pets and yearn for a harmonious life where they can play with their pets. Pets have become part of our family members. This also means that pets need to be taken care of like our family members. The owner will naturally take some responsibilities in daily care. The Peterest Team hopes to share the responsibilities with pet lovers, reduce work, make pet raising easier, and let every pet family have more time to enjoy the fun of life with pets.",

                "Title": "Accession v2: A Prototype Computer That Subverts Ransomwares",
                "Text": "Accession v2 (version 2) is a complete computer system designed with one purpose in mind; integrate new, innovative ideas and methods in cybersecurity relating to design, hardware and software to take a more aggressive stance against ransomwares and viruses.The focus of this project is to build a prototype of Accession v2.What Innovative Ideas Will Accession v2 Use?Accession v2 is an all inclusive way of looking at security for your computer and network. It is a combined hardware and software solution designed with the following features:1. easy migration of your current system into Accession v2;2. makes your computer completely inaccessible when you are not using it;3. employs a philosophy of compartmentalization in computer, hardware and software design;4. integrates a multitude of security software;5. contains double encrypted partitions on all storage devices;6. multiple backup, data recovery and remediation systems;7. uses the weapons a hacker employs against them;8. utilizes a USB \"key\" to run the entire system;9. compartmentalization of data, software and hardware.None of these may seem “revolutionary”, but how we use them is.Why Have All These Security Features?Why integrate all these security features into one computer? To answer that, let’s look at the weaknesses of current cybersecurity philosophy and computers in general and how Accession v2 solves them.1. Centralized Protection and Detection of EndpointsUsing a centralized IDS (Intrusion Detection System) to protect the endpoints (end-user computers) actually removes protection away from the main point of attack, which is the endpoints. Why not have each endpoint monitor, protect and recover itself? Accession v2 accomplishes this with integrated software all run by a separate operating system, giving the illusion of multiple centralized IDS systems to confuse and deter would-be hackers while still protecting the main points of attack.2. Standard Structure of ComputersAll computers, whether PCs or MACs, follow the same basic structure. A main hard drive for storage of data with services running to operate that computer. This is like a maze where you already know the correct path to take. It’s basically pointing hackers to where your sensitive data is stored. Accession v2 compartmentalizes the entire system, hardware and software, to change the maze up, creating confusion because your data is not where it’s supposed to be.3. Standardized Recovery SystemsHaving standard, centralized recovery and backup systems makes it easier for hackers to find and encrypt or even delete your backups. And by having a centralized backup, it gives the hackers one target to hit, which is much easier than the several targets created by Accession v2 due to the separation of their multiple backups and each endpoint within the network having the ability to recover itself.4. The Current Focus in Cybersecurity PhilosophyThe current philosophy in cybersecurity methods is to focus on the unknown. WHAT could the next breach be? WHAT will the next vulnerability or exploit be? WHAT new method of infiltration will hackers use? Why? Why focus on the guessing game. This is a REACTIVE posture and causes the industry to play catch up. A new breach happens, the industry races to patch it. Another new breach happens, the industry races to patch that, and so on and so on. Let’s focus on what we KNOW a ransomware does, instead of GUESSING what it will do. We KNOW a ransomware encrypts your data. We KNOW some ransomwares delete your data. We KNOW some ransomwares steal your data. By focusing on the KNOWN instead of the UNKNOWN, this creates a posture of ACTION instead of REACTION. Accession v2 accomplishes this by focusing on remediation of your encrypted or deleted data and wields tools to prevent your data from being stolen.CompartmentalizationCompartmentalization- the division of something into sections or categories. Also a military term for separating the details of an operation between operatives to prevent the entire operation from being compromised if any one operative is captured.This is the philosophy behind Accession v2.How Does Accession v2 Compartmentalize Hardware to Protect a Computer?At the core of Accession v2 is a USB flash drive that it uses as a \"key\". This flash drive houses RiseOS, our own operating system that runs the entire computer. When this \"key\" is removed, it \"bricks\" the computer, making your data completely inaccessible as there is no operating system to hack. This flash drive will also be the “key” to accessing OmniscentOS, our specially designed operating system that contains the multitude of security software to protect the system as well as detect any breaches or intrusions. In addition, the basic structureof Accession v2 starts with two separate encrypted solid state drives with multiple partitions to store specialized operating system files (not actual operating system files) and the data from the two separate remediation systems.Imagine being able to physically secure your computer in something as simple as a lock box when your work day is over. Accession v2 allows you to do this and more. These \"keys\" can even be assigned to employees if multiple people use the same computer, further increasing security and control of your network. This “key” can also be used as a killswitch for the system, stopping the spread of a dangerous ransomware in its tracks.This USB “key” will also contain EpioneOS, named after the Greek goddess of healing, a third operating system designed specifically for data recovery, repair and remediation on Accession v2 that can be booted to instead of RiseOS as a last line of defense. EpioneOS will also be completely hidden from RiseOS and all other operating systems working within it, making it virtually invisible to any viral or ransomware attack.How Does Accession v2 Compartmentalize Software to Protect a Computer?Accession v2 doesn't rely only on its unique structure for security, it will contain software solutions to help protect your data. This includes encryption on all hard drives, primary and secondary remediation systems to recover your entire computer in the event of a catastrophic viral infection (including ransomwares!) or other disastrous failure, such as a system crash. Accesssion v2 also contains OmniscentOS, a secondary operating system within RiseOS, that includes real-time monitoring, intrusion detection, wireless intrusion detection, file integrity monitoring and other security software. All these features are separated between RiseOS and OmniscentOS, so if one operating system fails, you can still remediate Accession v2 through the other. And, as mentioned above, Accession v2 will also have EpioneOS that can be booted to separately, just in case everything else fails.You Mentioned Easy Migration?Accession v2 will have the ability to not only run RiseOS and OmniscentOS, but another operating system that can be a migration of your current Windows® system, or a fresh installation, all simultaneously. This migration process, housed on the USB “key”, has been designed to be as easy and stress free as possible. This means your current computer, programs AND data can all be transferred into Accession v2 with no loss of functionality.All this compartmentalization combined with your data separated between multiple encrypted physical locations, which are only accessible through the USB \"key\", decreases the chances of any of your data becoming compromised.Didn’t We Say Something About Using a Hacker’s Tools Against Them?Yes we did. Why should a virus only be detrimental to a system? Can a virus protect your data as well? Yes it can. Accession v2 will employ a triggered virus that will destroy your data to prevent it from being stolen if a breach is detected. There is nothing to worry about though, as within RiseOS and OmniscentOS, there are primary and secondary remediation systems to recover your data within Accession v2 after the threat is over!The Project As It Sits NowAs of the writing of this project, we currently have two \"working models\" of Accession v2 (NEITHER is an actual prototype, as these \"working models\" are not built using the planned form factor, CPU, RAM or hard drive specifications of the actual proposed prototype system, however, RiseOS is installed on, and working from, a USB flash drive on both \"working models\"). These \"working models\" were built so we could begin the coding and building of the operating system and additional security features, and to start preliminary testing. The images above contain actual screenshots of RiseOS. We added the monitor to make it look fancy. We have secured a vendor, and contacted numerous others, to manufacture the prototype computer (without the operating system) and the finished systems.RiseOS is 90% complete as of this writing. It is based on another operating system, SanctumOS, we created for another solution, SanctumNE, offered by Archai Solutions, LLC, so the basics are already in place, what is remaining to complete is additional in-depth coding to enhance the security software and remediation systems and to tighten up the look and feel of the operating system to make it more familiar and user-friendly. We are also developing a simpler graphical interface for unlocking the encrypted drives. OmniscentOS is about 50% complete, with the virus “booby trap” still under development. EpioneOS is almost complete as well, due to it’s singular focus, it has been the easiest to code.The \"working models\" of Accession v2 have gone through preliminary testing of the primary and secondary remediation systems against ransomware infections; specifically Petya, NotPetya, WannaCry and Ryuk. We believed this was essential to complete as soon as possible as this is a primary feature of Accession v2. These remediation plans have been used successfully on other solutions offered by Archai Solutions, LLC, but not with this complex of a design. They have performed admirably in all preliminary tests and recovered 100% from each infection. The recovery process took between 32 and 53 minutes depending on the infection and whether it was the primary or secondary remediation system. We project that the actual prototype recovery time will be quicker due to the higher proposed hardware specifications. Below is a screen capture of a ransomware infection on Accession v2 and the recovery process through the primary remediation system. This video has been edited ONLY for time constraints. We don't believe ANYONE wants to sit through a 53-minute video of a bar slowly moving across the screen, although we will make the complete, unedited video available to any backer who wishes to see it. The secondary remediation system does take the computer out of the operating system, so doing a screen capture of this remediation system will be a little difficult. This secondary remediation system is planned only to be used as a last ditch recovery system.Plans for FundingThe funds we are raising will be used for the following:-  The materials for, and construction of, an actual prototype system, this includes all the proposed hardware (i.e. form factor shell, CPU, motherboard, RAM, hard drives and USB drive);-  The hiring of one or two additional employees for additional coding, both controlled-environment and \"real world\" testing, and other responsibilities;-  The filing of a provisional patent and of the actual patent once Accession v2 is completed;-  Expenses associated with testing Accession v2 in a \"real world\" business environment. This includes the cost of commonly used business software such as Quickbooks, MySQL, CRM software, etc. to ensure Accession v2 does not inhibit any such software;-  Expenses associated with testing Accession v2 within different business network structures. This includes, but is not limited to, virtual servers, VPNs, networked drives, NAS systems, cloud storage, cloud computing, etc.;-  The writing, editing and printing of a \"quick start\" user's manual and the creation of a troubleshooting website;-  An additional \"slush\" fund for unexpected expenses. We have tried to take into account any and all expenses associated with this project, but as any creator or developer will tell you, there is always something unexpected that appears.The TeamWe are not new to technology. Our team has a combined 60 years working with, building and designing computers, hardware and software. We are fully versed in multiple forms of coding for Windows and Linux. The principle architects of Accesssion are:Josh Van Metre, Owner and Chief Innovation OfficerJosh started his own computer repair and service company, Trust Tech Management in 2015 geared towards providing honest, inexpensive and quality computer services for small businesses and residential users. Realizing there was a need for innovative cybersecurity solutions for businesses, he started Archai Solutions, LLC (www.archaisolutions.com) unofficially in 2020 and officially in 2021, absorbing Trust Tech Management in the process, with the philosophy that standard cybersecurity techniques were not working and new, revolutionary solutions were needed. If the accepted solutions were enough, hackers and ransomware attacks would still not be the threat they are.Leah Streepy, Director of Client ServicesLeah is relatively new to the technology and cybersecurity industry, joining Archai Solutions, LLC in 2020 as Director of Client Services, but her enthusiasm, intelligence, drive and refreshing ideas have been indispensable to the development of this project. “Techie” people have a tendency to forget that not everyone has their level of knowledge and Leah’s wealth of experience with clients and marketing has kept this project grounded and focused on the ease-of-use feature that is vital for this system.",

                "Text": "This i how easy it will be to clean it off, the results will vary based on how large the cup is, you notice that all the chocolate is on the counter its all no longer something that you have to scrub. This cup wasn't a perfect fit I'm thinking about including multiple brushes for different size cups. as of right now I'm only going to sell the two brushes.Hello there my name is Eric. I had originally created this invention it was supposed to be a push button motor that used batteries or plugged into your wall. It also used a gravity fed soap distributor and had a water line attached to the side. Part of me wanted to release this product but I thought what’s more eco-friendly, one product that uses electricity or something that doesn’t consume electricity and can be used thousands of times before it breaks down. (Plastic breaks down over the course of several hundred years.) I went with this eco-friendly idea because deep down inside I am a tree hugger at heart, I want future generations to have a life as good as previous generations. (I develop these types of products to make everyone life better.) Back when I was a kid, I was always stuck cleaning the dishes at my house and I always thought that there's got to be a more efficient way to clean cups. Fast forward to the present day, I learned about gears and gear ratios, and I decided to combine both a brush and a gear-based object and behold now we have the countertop spin brush was born.Right now, this is a functional prototype (as you can see it spins properly), the only difference between this and the final product is that right now I have the wrong spring installed as of right now. Assuming there is a demand for my product, This will be fixed before product launch. The spring WILL be the correct size for launch.Just to show you without any load the current spring does in fact work, but for the final product the spring will be much larger and it will be optimized to function more desirable than it currently is. When the final product has this spring active capability to make it will make your cup cleaning life EVEN easier.This video shows it in action. please take note how much chocolate was removed from the cup after pulling the lever 4 times. I made it so the chocolate is visually on the sink so you can see how much chocolate it actually removed. When you go to use the spin brush you will want to place just next to the sink so that the food particles fall inside the sink. I left it on the counter top for visual representation.This i how easy it will be to clean it off, the results will vary based on how large the cup is, you notice that all the chocolate is on the counter its all no longer something that you have to scrub. this cup wasn't a perfect fit I'm thinking about including multiple brushes for different size cups. as of right now i'm only going to sell the two brushes. this is how simple it will be to clean the brush.The second attachment cleans bottles.It takes 15-30 seconds to clean a cup normally. The countertop spin brush lowers this down to 3-6 seconds with the help of gear ratios. Each time you pull the lever it should rotate 3 times. (because it is a 3 to 1 gear ratio)Let's say you have 20 cups*30 seconds=600 seconds to clean normally/60 seconds per min=means you waste 10 mins of your life every week. this is assuming you are cleaning 20 cups that day.3*20= 60 seconds6*20= 120 secondsIt depends on how many cups you produce every week, you could save a significant amount of time for people with large families.Who is this Product aimed toward?1). People who are prone to arthritis. Older people might not have enjoy turning their wrist while washing cups and my product is here to make their life easier.2). Households with large family’s that go through many cups and your average household. (I don't want kids to waste their time scrubbing cups and this was one of the reasons why I invented this. They should spend less time washing cups and more time with their family.)3). Restaurants that use cups.What else can it be used on?Protein shaker bottlesThis is how it worksStep 1 Pick up the cupStep 2 Rinse the inside Step 3 Pull lever 1-3 times (It took me about a second and a half in the video.)Step 4 ???? (Gears aren't magic, they are mechanical engineering, so it's not really a mystery by any means.)Step 5 Profit ?!? (Some people say time is money, so I'm here to help you save it. I like to think that your time is far more valuable than any amount of money in this world. The fact that life is so short makes time a very valuable commodity. )Step 6 Put the cup in the dish strainer/dishwasher.Safety FeaturesThat square box=Prevents bodily damage by acting as a barrier between you and the gears. The box is rounded so that it won't cut the user.There are no sharp external edges in my design, everything is smooth.Other FeaturesThings that will change before product launchThe current spring size will be changed to make cup cleaning even easier.After recent feedbackI have decided that I'm going with the quick release pin to the shaft so you can quickly swap between the cup brush and the bottle cleaner. (I realized that people would likely loose the lock pin and now that wont be a problem because the quick release pin will be a part of the shaft.)Things that might change before product launchThe delivery date may be earlier assuming i get help along the way, if not i am trying my best to get you your spin brush by next year. ill update you as much as i can if I'm successful. We will just have to wait and see what it will be like upon optimization.Multiple VersionsIn the future i wanted to create multiple versions if this is successful.The other versionsThe second Version will be intended for a handicapped person. This version will hold the cup for them, it will use water along with its spinning ability.I want to get market validation for the first before I start advertising the second version and third versions.I want to make an alternate version where the plastic is recyclable(petg). Right now its not going to be made out of recyclable plastic because if it were recyclable then the plastic alone would cost 11$ and i cannot afford this i was making 20K 3 years ago and my pay check has only increased so much since then.What happens if its not successful?I guess I’ll probably hang my prototype on a wall and stare at it. I think what really matters here is that I had the courage to leave my comfort zone and try advertise my product. With my current trajectory this idea was going nowhere fast. At the end of the day I think the only thing that matters is that I tried.While I’m on the topic of my company named NÜDDEN ill go ahead and post my company goals while I’m here.I'm currently developing a phone based application. In the distant future may release an invention that would potentially help dispose of all the worlds plastic pollution. One day I hope to release a video game similar to D&D.",

This time we put in even more time and effort planning our Kickstarter, and used all the lessons and skills we learned to better prepare for manufacturing to scale up our volume to be able to offer a new, lower price.Finally, while the funding raised by a Kickstarter campaign is important for covering the costs of tooling and a large initial order, it's not the only reason we chose to launch on this platform again.  The value we received from backers of our first campaign, the interactions, feedback, and lasting relationships, played a monumental role in our long-term success and to this day continues to have an impact driving innovation and improvements with our technology.Collaborators:This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 2,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $900M raised between them.",

Posts are intended to inform the user about an issue and/or show ways they can help. Posts are made by individuals, organizations (i.e. non-profits), and public sites (i.e. news, Go Fund Me, etc.) via RSS feeds. The opportunities to help span multiple avenues - advocacy, protesting, policy/petitions, donations, volunteering, etc. Doing so, makes collective impact more achievable. Additional features include: subscribing to verified users only, upvoting content, share options to other social media platforms, a rewards system to drive user engagement, and ability to filter to global and local content.\n What problem is Reform trying to solve?The missing intersection between information about current social and environmental issues and a diverse offering of solutions to address those issues. There’s a knowledge gap across the United States about the issues many communities are experiencing today and why those issues are problematic. Secondly, there is not one cohesive platform that educates people on these issues while providing solutions that a population at varying income levels and ages can take action on. In order for change to happen, we must learn and take action in whatever capacity we can.What do I need funding for?I currently have wireframes and a video prototype for the app. I'm looking for funding to turn these wireframes into an app that can be found on the Apple app store! I have a qualified engineer ready to work on the development, all I need is help with funding.Any support is appreciated!!  ",

Meet the largest and most elegant Nixie lamp in the world ever produced for the public! If you want to live a more relaxed life, you will love these clocks. They literally combine time and leisure.The ZIN clock shares 2 vivid traces of Nixie technology. Nixie numerical indication technology makes very accurate counting and applies in space flights.  Also, beautiful Nixie neon discharge technology applies in light advertisements on shops and illuminations in Disneyland and Las Vegas.We believe that you can enjoy this beautiful indication technology more often.The largest Nixie tube in the world:1. The gas is evacuated from the tube.2. A little but well-measured amount of neon or argon is infused in the tube.3. The tube represents a well-sealed bulb with electrodes coming out of its base, anode mesh and cathode filaments.4. When a voltage is applied to the two electrodes, the gas in the tube allows the current to flow.5. The digits light up and one can observe the plasma or gas discharge around the digits.ZIN clock is an art piece1. The glass and the mechanism of the clock have been elaborated with remarkably high precision.2. ZIN18 and ZIN70 Nixie clocks represent a new variety of IN and Z types of Nixie lamps. This contributes to historical Nixie tubes’ development.3. ZIN70 clock has the largest ever Nixie tube in the world produced for the public. It more resembles Z-type tubes - z568m.4. ZIN18 clock has the most elegant Nixie tube. It is elongated and neat. It more resembles IN-type tubes - IN18.ZIN clock for the house and laid-back lifestyleYou can place this clock on the shelf or the table of your living room, bedroom, or kitchen.Apart from showing the time in an easy format, it will brighten any room and make it more vivid.Single-digit neon clock for chalet cabin and beach house.Nothing will bring more style, history, and laid-back air into the room as this one-digit neon lights clock. It is perfect for the houses where you go to recover your energy. Looking at this clock sometimes feels like looking at a fireplace. In the mountains, in the forest, by the ocean or the lake, it shows the time in natural[EL2]  lights of electric current.Single-digit neon clock for creative workshopsThis clock fits well in creative workshops and studios for artists, writers, photographers, and sculptures. It is also the best for scientists and researchers. In general, you will enjoy it if time is not a constraint in your work. This clock does not give you extra information, it is not pressing, and it is creative.ZIN Nixie tube is almost eternalThe ZIN Nixie lamp is made of stainless steel. We annealed the glass of the lamp to make it super strong. Also, we flawlessly crafted the mechanism of the tube. The envelope of the lamp is securely sealed. It is only the aging of the components that can impact its functioning. That is why the lamp’s service life is unlimited.Time synchronizationFor time counting, this ZIN clock uses an HV5622 micro scheme and displays one digit. The most fascinating fact lies in the most accurate numeric display technology not requested to be the most precise.The ZIN clock has an alarm. You can set it for the morning or any other time. With this clock, you can always be on time and never miss your schedule.The clock that only counts hours can also chime to announce each new hour. We created stylish chimes in diverse themes.Tweak ZIN clock● Tweak RGB of underlights● Tweak gradual switch of the digitsIf you are a Nixie tubes enthusiast, you can use the ZIN70 lamp  instead of your z568m lamp on your own devices. You can easily disconnect the ZIN70 lamp from the clock.“Slot machine” for lamp protectionThe clock, by default, protects “relaxed” filaments from the particles of active filaments. Once in a while, it flips through all the digits. This process is called a “Slot machine.” It successfully solves the issue of cathodes poisoning and protects the lamp.Supply voltage - 12VAverage consumption of current - 1AHighest consumption of current - 1AHighest power consumption - 14WInput voltage - 12V DCEasy settingThe setting up process of this clock is  extremely easy and intuitive. You can set the clock with the two press buttons that you can find on its base. You will need to follow the Table of settings that is given in the clock’s User guide. First, you will need to select a parameter and then assign a value to it.The ZIN70 and ZIN18 lamps can serve forever. They have а 15- year  warranty. Theelectronic part of the clock serves on average for 5 years.About the teamWe are a small company that produces Nixie devices such as clocks, watches, and thermometers. We love beautiful and historical technologies that are gas discharge numerical indication. We want to make it more advanced, adapted, and affordable for the public. We have a new laboratory with the most modern equipment for Nixie tubes production. There, we design and produce Nixie clocks.

It uses a system called stenography which is a system of writing word by word through strokes and chords.If you want to type faster, sure, you can practice Qwerty every day, or maybe learn a new keyboard layout such as Colemak, Dvorak, or Workman. But you are limited by the keyboard itself; you can only achieve so much with a keyboard that lets you type only one letter at a time. Qwerty was actually designed to slow you down to prevent jams in the typewriter machine!Stenography is different. The system was developed with the sole intention of keeping up with the speed of human speech. The average person speaks at about 180 WPM and the average court reporter (people who use stenography to transcribe court proceedings) can type at 200 WPM easily for up to several hours. Prototype Uni v1:February 2021: Green PCB without even a backplate. Fully functional, but could use some design upgrades.Uni v2:May 2021: Matte Black PCB with backplate compatibility. This design allows for greater flexibility when designing cases in the future.  Uses a pro micro (the blue rectangle), just like the v1 so it uses a micro USB port. Uni v3 (now):September 2021: Integrated brain, no more pro micro design. Uses a USB Type C connection. Still uses the same backplate, but provides better aesthetics and reliability due to the lack of a pro micro. It has built-in electrostatic discharge protection. The PCB is only compatible with MX switches.Here is a great video explaining in depth what steno and Plover are (she is using the Uni v2):This project was brought to you by:Peter Park: The voice in the video and designer of the Uni.Sophia Park: Graphic design.Sarah Park: Graphic design.Website: https://www.stenokeyboards.com/",

We are excited to bring this opportunity to the public and seek their support to SAVE LIVES.James and Maria are reaching out to the public seeking funding for their invention. They have filed non-provisional patents with the USPTO for their invention along with trademark applications for the name.They invented a new way to cut the grass, the “Laser Lawnmower”, and are seeking funding from the public.We are needing the money for the creation of a prototype.We are confident once we have a prototype you will see this invention in a store near you.For almost 100 years the lawnmower has not changed in design with its spinning metal blades.Each year, thousands of people in the United States go to the Emergency Room, due to lawnmower injuries and deaths.This is costing Millions of dollars a year, just in injuries and deaths. Plus, several Millions in property damage from things being broken from items being kicked out from the spinning of the metal blades.*** Even Pets are injured and killed EACH year from objects thrown at them by the lawnmowers.***People are injured and property is damaged from the spinning blades from a lawnmower. These blades kick out (from under the lawnmower), rocks and sticks at high rates of speed.\"We still see too many foot injuries from power lawnmowers,\" says foot and ankle surgeon James Thomas, DPM, FACFAS. \"The blades whirl at 3,000 revolutions per minute and produce three times the kinetic energy of a 357 handgun.\"“American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons: “The energy transferred by a typical lawn mower blade is equivalent to being shot with a 357 magnum pistol.”A study released in 2018 by researchers at Johns Hopkins Medicine found that lawn mower injuries, most of which require surgery, cost an average of $37,000 per patient. The study examined lawn-mower-related Emergency Room visits from 2006 to 2013.We NEED your help to raise this money so we can help prevent injuries and deaths. PLEASE help us to help others. EVERY dollar gets us closer to the goal.This lawnmower could prevent you or one of your loved ones from being injured or killed.God Bless everyone who took the time to read this and for those generous few whom provided funding.Take care,FREQUENT ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)1. How do I know this is legit and not a scam?a. We are a real company based out of Fargo, North Dakota, and registered with the North Dakota Secretary of State. This is real and NOT a scam.2.  Will the Laser Lawnmower catch the grass on fire?a. Most people will only cut their grass when it is healthy and growing, hence forth why they are cutting the grass. Healthy normal grass is made up of mostly water 70%- 85% water. There is no fear of it catching fire.i. Click on the link for more facts about lawns:1. https://www.mowmore.com/blogs/news/lawn-and-turfgrass-facts-and-stats2. https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/10/opinion/l-need-water-try-grass-468401.htmlb. There are some people whom would cut “dry” or “dead” grass. In theory, that could cause a fire hazard. With that said, we have made modifications and designs to the patent.c. *** We have added several water jets (found after the lasers have cut the grass) which will spray water onto the clippings to prevent any possibility of catching fire. This is an OPTION which can be turned off by the user. If they are cutting healthy grass there is no need to have the jets spraying on the clippings.3. Is the Laser Lawnmower really safe? What if I get cut by the Laser Lawnmower?a. It is important to note that IF a person were to get their foot or fingers under the lawnmower deck, it will be cut off no matter if it was the metal blade or a laser.b. The BIG difference between getting cut be a laser and a metal blade is how the wound looks. From a medical point, it would be easier to attached a severed finger, toe, hand or other body part when it was cut off by a laser. A Laser will make a straight “clean” cut, which a medical surgeon will be able to attach it much easier.c. However, in the same situation of a body part being cut off by a metal blade, the wound would be different. The edges will be jagged and torn. It may or may notbe able to be attached as easily as a laser wound.d. Another issue is the infection possibility. The laser would NOT have any germs which would enter the wound when it is cut, because of the intense heat. Where as a metal blade would have grass, dirt, and germs on the blade.e. Another point will be that IF a person were to get their foot or hand under the deck of the lawnmower, the normal spinning metal blades covers the entire area under the deck of the lawnmower.i. But the small area for the lasers will be about 1 inch from the left side to the right side of the lawnmower deck. So, unless that person who accidentally went under at the exact point of the laser’s they will not get injured.ii. There is a 100% chance of a person getting injured from a spinning metal blade IF they get their body part under the lawnmower deck.iii. There is a 10% chance of a person getting injured IF they get their body part under the lawnmower deck, because the lasers ONLY go from one side of the deck to the other side. There is 90% of the area which would be safe IF a person got under the lawnmower.5. How safe is it IF a person fell off while driving a riding lawnmower?a. As you can see from the diagram a person who accidentally fell while riding on the riding lawnmower will have a less of chance of injury or death with the Laser Lawnmower than the spinning blade mower.b. It would be more likely a person whom fell (while sitting on a riding lawnmower) will miss the lasers, since the lasers are stationed further forward on the mower. While on a traditional spinning blade mower the person would 100% be injured by the spinning blades.5. How many lives will be saved by using the Laser Lawnmower?a. 100%of the people (would be affected) whom would have been injured or killed by an object being thrown at them from the spinning blades. Laser lawnmowers do NOT have spinning blades.b. Roughly 80%-90% of people (would be affected) whom would have been injured or killed when they accidentally fell under the push or riding lawnmower, since the danger area of the lasers will greatly be reduced by 90%.6. How will the Laser Lawnmower save lives?a. The Laser Lawnmower will NOT have any spinning blades which will kick out objects at the speed of a .357 magnum handgun. People will not be struck and harmed by any spinning blades.7. How many people are injured/killed from lawnmowers each year?a. For those wondering about the REAL numbers of injuries from lawnmowers: Here are the facts from the Government website of CPSC.gov and the American Hospital Association aha.org.b. Here is the link to the NEISS Data Highlights for Calendar Year 2019: https://www.cpsc.gov/s3fs-public/2019-NEISS-data-highlights.pdf?ZU3YoE6xnBRIICuP8BvBRpsXMV7Tb9sgc. The report stated the following: “The 2019 NEISS estimates have been produced from a sample of 96 hospitals, including children's hospitals. Information from NEISS is available to the public through CPSC's National Injury Information Clearinghouse  (phone: 301-504-7921) and online at www.cpsc.gov/en/Research--Statistics/NEISS-Injury-Data/“d. ***NOTE: This is an estimate of injuries from ONLY 96 hospitals.***e. On page 3 of the report, it reported 77,244 injuries from lawnmowers.f. Since, this report ONLY took a sample of 96 hospitals we must look at how many hospitals there are in the United States.g. Here is the link to the American Hospital Association: https://www.aha.org/statistics/fast-facts-us-hospitalsh. As of 2021 there are a “Total Number of All U.S. Hospitals 6,090”i. To get the rough estimate of injuries from lawnmowers per year FROM ALL HOSPITALS, we will use the estimate from the 2019 NEISS Report of 77,244 (From 96 hospitals).j. There are 6090 hospitals and divide that by 96.k. 6090 divided by 96 equals 63.l. IF we are to estimate how many lawnmower injuries there are in the entire United States, we will have to multiply the 2019 NEISS reported lawnmower injures of 77,244 by 63.m. That gives us an estimate of 4,866,372 injuries from lawnmowers from ALL United States Hospitals EACH YEAR.8. Will the Laser Lawnmower SAVE me MONEY?a. YES! It will SAVE you MONEY!b.

Plus you get thumping, room reverberating lows with the 30 watt woofer. Enjoy unbelievable realism. You will feel like you're in the same room with the musicians.Each enclosure has its advantages and disadvantages. We combine them to overcome their disadvantages and get the best of both worlds. The disadvantage of an open baffle is the reduced bass reproduction. This is balanced by sound with more openness, less sound distortion and greater speaker efficiency due to the same pressure on both sides of the speaker membrane. The perfect sound characteristics are completed by a subwoofer in minimalist body which is tuned for an authentic low end.Highly efficient transparent open baffle design with two aluminum cone 15 W speakers designed in the USA, delivers clean spacious highs and mids, along with a 30 W woofer in the rigid aluminum body for deep precise low-end.Use the classy leather handle with stainless steel frame to take the speaker with you everywhere you go. Instantly connects with your phone to play your favorite jams loud and proud. The low profile of the speaker is also ideal for use as a TV/PC soundbar, thanks to analog input.You'll love the minimalist, easy operation. Simply connect via Bluetooth 5.1 Audio Apt-X HD with your phone's Bluetooth for fabulous clear, full bodied sound that stuns friends and passersby.

                "Text": "Winter warmth with the addition of hi tech and hi fashion.  It's hard to find a heated puffer coat that is both fashionable and functional so we have designed one!  A Heated Puffer Coat that is stylish with lots of additional features, like an attachable bag, removable sleeves, lots of hidden pockets and a unique art lining.  Made from 100% recycled nylon on the outer and 100% recycled poly for the lining we have not compromised on fabric quality and hardware.  At Consequence of Change we collaborate with artists to create unique products for our community and we believe that we have created the most versatile Heated Puffer Coat.Our Puffer Coat has four nano heating pads.  Two on the back and one in each pocket.The Nano Heating Technology pads are made from carbon nano tube film and  created to be soft and lightweight.  You will not know the pads are there!  They have been safety tested by our supplier and we can provide certifcation if required.You choose how warm you want to be with the touch of a button (inside the coat). Press once for the lowest temperature and up to four times for the highest temperature.We tested our coat out, this is what our customers had to say.Battery Charger: We have added a pocket 3/4 of the way down the coat for the power pack.  Every coat comes with a FREE battery pack with universal adaptability.Detachable Bag:  The first Puffer Coat to feature a detachable bag with magnetic attachment to make it easy to put on. The bag is reversible, features two pockets on each side and has an adjustable strap.Removable Sleeves: Zip off your sleeves for those not so chilly days and turn your coat into a vest.Handy Sleeve Pocket: We have added a convenient pocket on the sleeve to carry your cell phone, credit card, keys or whatever you want.  Easy to reach! Ear Pod Pocket: We have also added a neat little side pocket on the sleeve to hold your ear pod case.When it came to chosing an artist to work with for this project we really wanted to collaborate with an Indigenous artist.  So after much searching we engaged Niketa Law a contemporary Aboriginal artist. Her inspiration for Barambah Winds came from her home in the Australian Hinterland and has been created exclusively for us.  Hi, my name is Beverley and I am the Founder of Consequence of Change.  We are a small but mighty brand.  Our purpose is to support the arts with our art collaborations.  We commission each piece of work to ensure the artist  is paid fairly. We also do this so that our customer has something truly unique.  We are small batch so only offer very limited numbers due to the costs and also wanting to keep our products one of a kind.  This coat has been my dream since visiting Iceland and my Puffer Coat just did not do it's job.  So by supporting  us you are going to receive something truly special.It is really important that you follow our recommendation on how to choose the right size for you:As you are going to be measuring for a coat we recommend taking your measurements over your regular clothes.  Chest measurement:  The chest is the most important body part for coat measurements.  Stand up straight, relax your arms at your side.  Ideally ask someone to help - wrap the tape measure around your chest area making sure the tape measure has some room (max 1\"/2.54cm) to move.  If you want the jacket to fit looser you should add an additional inch/cm.  Measure horizontally around the body at the strongest part of the chest.Hip measurement:  The hip is measured in the same way as above.  Measure horizontally at the widest area.See our chart below for more guidance:When we reach our goal, you will be sent a survey to ensure you get the size you requested.Shipping costs will be charged after the campaign is finished. The reason for this is that due to COVID there is massive volatility on shipping prices and fixing them months in advance from our side could translate to higher costs for everyone.  Our  estimation is that the cost will be around USD $20.  We will be working hard to achieve the best balance of shipping speed and cost efficiency for you.  We will remain 100% transparent regarding shipping costs and will pass on any potential savings.  We don't profit at all from shipping but actually subsidise part of the shipping costs.  We are working with our 3PL supplier to get the best rates possible.  Please note that your battery and coat will come in separate shipments as the battery has to be mailed through a different shipping channel and doing it this way will make it as cost effective as possible.If you need to exchange your coat due to size not being right you will need to ship the coat to us at your expense however we will re ship to you at our expense.  Coat must be returned unwashed, in same condition you received it.  It cannot have been worn.We acknowledge that we are on the lands of the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin Nations who have been custodians of this land for thousands of years, and acknowledge and pay our respects to their Elders past, present and emerging.",

Would also offer online ordering so you can pick up your food instead of having to wait in lines. This eliminates boring regular food pick up, eliminates having the same meals everyday because the menu would change daily or weekly. How Nice would it be to be able to step foot out your house and to be able to get different meals daily....without having to drive or shop.

                "Text": "For nearly a decade, LiONCooler has been known for its battery-powered solar fridge freezers and our dedication to providing off-grid and portable power solutions to consumers. We’re so excited and proud to introduce the LiONCooler Pro, the newest technology in the portable, fridge, freezer, cooler market - designed with more versatility with a battery that also functions as an external power bank so you can power on-the-go.Everyone knows that when the ice melts, there’s condensation, water drips everywhere and food gets soggy. Those are the old days, the LiONCooler Pro needs no ice. The integrated compressor allows the cooler to function as a refrigerator or freezer except in a portable and cordless design.The LiONCooler Pro has all of the advantages of your home’s refrigerator but it’s designed to be completely portable, battery-operated and cordless so you can take it with you in your car, RV, boat, camping, fishing, tailgating and you want to enjoy cold food and drinks.When you’re on the road or the outdoors, you want a reliable, portable, cooler. The LiONCooler Pro features a powerful temperature control system that can maintain a steady temperature even in the most extreme environments engineered with a DC compressor and a long-lasting Lithium-ion battery, giving you up to 12 hours of uninterrupted chilling.The LiONCooler Pro lets you quickly recharge its removable battery in 3 convenient ways: using the AC wall outlet of your home or hotel room, a DC 12v socket from your vehicle and using solar power panels. For a complete off-grid experience, pair the LiONCooler Pro with solar power panels from ACOPower to enjoy cool drinks and food in the backcountry. The charging cycle takes 4 to 6 hours and the battery holds power for 12 hours with two batteries you can enjoy 24 hours of battery-operated cooling.Unlike other fridge-freezer coolers, the LiONCooler Pro is 100% mobile - no need to keep it plugged into your vehicle our electrical outlet. The powerful battery stays operating for up to 12 hours and can be recharged in the car or with a solar power panel at the campsite, beach, tailgate or park.That’s right: you can finally forget about those messy coolers that require ice to keep food and drinks cold and can quickly become a soggy mess. The LiONCooler Pro puts the ice in the past, offering you a smart, dry, realizable and portable fridge and freezer experience.While you want some things frozen, some other things should just be refrigerated. LiONCooler Pro features both functions powered by its high-quality DC Compressors. Simply adjust the desired function you need it for at any time using the device’s digital LCD display—choosing from -20℃ Freezing to a milder adjustable Chilling function, without having its temperature affected by the weather.Since the Lithium-ion battery is removable, you can take it out and use it as a standalone powerbank for your phone, laptop, outdoor lighting and other devices with USB ports.LiONCooler Pro is designed to be as convenient as a trolley bag. Simply pull the telescopic handle and you’re good to go. Seamlessly take your LiONCooler Pro anywhere, without lifting or holding it, and enjoy its robust all-terrain 6 inches extra-large wheels that will literally let you take it off-road.The removable multi-purpose lid provides more access to your cooler and can also be used as a food prep table. Plus, you can easily remove to wash and clean.  Another key feature that makes LiONCooler Pro innovative is the ability to charge through solar power. Just connect the cooler directly to a solar power panel and enjoy the green and environmentally-friendly charging and keep drinks and food cold completely off-grid.Want even more convenience? If temperature changes outdoors or if you simply want to adjust the chilling temperature of the device, you can adjust the cooler’s temperature on the digital LCD display or remotely, from its free Bluetooth App available for iOS or Android.Crowdfunding is not new to us, we successfully funded our first project here: the 3rd generation LiONCooler. Since then, the LiONCooler has been tried and tested by thousands of consumers, it has even been used in the most sensitive medical environments, transporting medicine and organs, where reliable and steady temperatures are critically important.So what’s new? The LiONCooler Pro has a better 193Wh/52000mAh battery, that not only functions as a battery for your cooler but as a power bank for all devices.

The electric display is easy to see even in the dark, and it is easy to erase! Since it is dustless, it is completely harmless and hygienic to children even when used in restaurants. You can choose your favorite pen, brush, or stamp to freely express your creativity. It is easy to write with just a light touch of a finger, pen, or brush, and is easily erased by simply bringing the eraser magnet closer. The backlight LED is white. When used in color, a color filter can be inserted between the backlight and the screen to change the color into seven different colors.\"Beeboard Tub\" has 7,000 dots and \"Beeboard Graffiti\" has 14,000 dots. After the overall outline and composition is drawn, each stroke is carefully added to achieve a delicate expression.The magnetic sheet on the surface and the eraser are permanent magnets, so they can be used indefinitely unless they are damaged. The LED backlight has an endurance of 30,000 hours.Unlike chalk, there is no dust when erasing, so you don't have to worry about inhaling chalk dust. It is notebook-sized and takes up very little space, even in limited spaces.At first glance, Beeboard looks like digital technology, but it is actually \"analog\" technology, using no semiconductor chips other than LEDs.\n   Therefore, you cannot connect to a PC, save, or transfer data, but you can enjoy the intuitive freedom of expression that only a no-chip, no-manual system can provide. There is a small indentation on the surface where a large number of steel balls are magnetically adsorbed, blocking the light from the backlight.By touching it with a brush or something, the steel ball is removed. Only the area where the balls fall, appears to glow through the light of the backlight.To erase, bring the eraser magnet close to the surface, and the fallen steel balls will be attracted to the original position, blocking the light from the backlight and erasing them.The material of the stamp is a hair-planting cloth, with fibers planted all over it. By pressing it, you can drop a steel ball and make it glow. If you make a letter or logo cut from a planting cloth, you can easily display it at any time.Backlight ModuleMagnetizing machine (to magnetize the panel surface)Precision Press MachineThe high technology of Japanese companies to precisely process materials that are difficult to process.The tablet size is easy to use, and you can choose your favorite color from black, red, or white.External ：W260mm   H180mm   D24mmSurface ：W200mm   H140mm   Weight ： 650gBack light ：SDM5050LEDPower consumption ：11.6WVoltage ：DC12VYou can place it on your desk and use the wide screen to draw freely.External ：W350mm   H240mm   D24mmSurface ：W280mm   H200mm   Weight ： 1250gBack light ：SDM5050LEDPower consumption ：11.6WVoltage ：DC12V※ Standard equipments with an AC adapter, color filters, and a set of accessories.(Included writing set contents) ※ Standard equipments with an AC adapter, color filters, and a set of accessories.(Included writing set contents)※ Standard equipments with an AC adapter, color filters, and a set of accessories.(Included writing set contents)Technical Artists develop and manufacture products that everyone can enjoy, based on the concept of \"the joy of drawing for everyone.”Through Beeboard, we provide the pure joy of expression to everyone from children to the elderly.Although digital technology has become the norm in many fields around the world, the analog method is not yet abandoned. Our goal is to help people understand the fun and enjoyment of the Beeboard method of drawing, to develop a new generation of blackboards, and to expand the ability of people to communicate with each other through visual recognition by spreading the use of free and flexible electronic displays that can be written on by hand.

Whatever it is you're growing, we want to help. After almost 2 years of prototyping, we've decided to launch a Kickstarter campaign to fund and pre-sell the mass-production of Oasis-Grow, our first line of environmental monitoring tools and automated container growing systems for hobbyists gardeners, underground cultivators, and small farmers.  Oasis-Grow, developed by Oasis-X, is our first fleet of products consisting of camera, remote sensing, and environmental control modules aimed to help smaller and medium-sized growers save time, measure what matters, and produce more with less. This lineup of growing automation products includes hardware and software modules for computer vision, environmental sensing, and AC equipment control as well as a few ready to grow container farming systems. Oasis-Grow is a modular, easy-to-use set of tools for growing more with less. It is designed to enable controlled environment agriculture but can be applied to other areas as well. Deploy a simple camera to track harvest-readiness of fruit, add sensors to diagnose problems in your environment, plug in a controller to create the perfect conditions, or skip all of this with a ready-to-grow system. Our products collect images & data over time, actively regulating temperature, relative humidity, airflow, light, oxygen, and water cycles. Sensors, cameras, and programmatic alerts can monitor your growing system, allowing you to catch and prevent problems before they occur.  Users can set variable targets for feedback response and tune the system's built in PID controllers to create more desirable environments. With the ability to deploy plug-and-play containers or hook up 3rd party AC appliances in a chosen space, growers can more easily create the perfect environment for their application. Our system can be used offline and is secure with data encrypted at rest and in-transit. NorthSpore Vertical Farm DailyMagPi: Official Raspberry Pi MagazineGet started using a ready-to-grow container farming system, or outfit your existing grow with one of our environmental helper modules.We wouldn't sell a product we wouldn't use, which is why our prototypes are tested extensively on our demo farm installation. Our technology has been used to build real systems that grow real crops, which we encourage you to check out on our website and instagram!Our open-source control software can take pictures, sense environmental factors, and command a variety of appliances to regulate your system. This means that you can modify core, extend with 3rd party electronics, and contribute new integrations + ideas! If you've ever used a Raspberry Pi or programmed a microcontroller, you'll be right at home accessing oasis-grow modules using the command line. Visit our GitHub to deploy your own configuration of our firmware. Build from scratch or add powerful new capabilities to an existing Pi setup. On-device buttons & an LED status ring light interface can be used to start/stop the control cycle, connect to wifi, or run the drainage pump. This is in addition to the dashboard, where you can view images and data sent from a unit, adjust settings, update firmware, and run other tasks.  Adding a new device to your network is as easy as pressing a button, waiting a bit, connecting to the hotspot, and entering your credentials:Our cloud dashboard (for which we will release an open-source version soon) aggregates visual & sensor data to generate actionable media & analysis. Assemble time-lapses to share, save data for traceability, and learn from the past to improve future harvests. We plan to implement even more sensor options and integrate some of our community-contributed AI projects into the core remote image monitoring system.Oasis-X was founded by two engineers and long-time gardeners in response to food shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have backgrounds in computer science, hobby electronics, business management, product design, ecology, and biotechnology. Our team is passionate about making the future of farming accessible in every neighborhood!We have have been iterating on designs for this idea since the beginning of 2020. It has been incredibly rewarding to see our hardware go from concept drawings, to functioning proof of concept prototypes, to rugged hand-assembled beta units. Next steps will be to smooth out the edges and update our existing prototype designs to optimize manufacturability.   The rapidly increasing consolidation of farmland over the past century has resulted in a centralized food system that pushes out small farmers and is fragile, wasteful, and damaging to our environment. To feed a growing global population, we’ll have to intensify these traditional farming and distribution methods which intensely pollute our atmosphere, soil, and water.We believe that buying and selling local is the solution for many problems which plague our food system. We have the opportunity to embrace an alternative which allows us to eat healthier, use fewer resources, connect with our food, and cultivate confidence in where our products come from.\n\n    In pursuit of this, our goal is to equip every cultivator with unprecedented control and visibility into their harvest. We aim to unlock the kind of productivity & resource-efficiency previously only achievable by those with capital to invest or deep technical expertise.",

Using GPS technology the APP moves with you and updates you on the surrounding safety conditions as you move from around your city, your country or around the world. Currently, We have identified and captured crime data within the U.S. and Covid-19 data within 180 countries world-wide, however we are seeking funding to expand our data collection efforts so that we can offer this app to all nations.Imagine travelling to a new City in which you have never been and trying to navigate the streets not knowing if it is safe, not knowing the crime rate, what is the Covid rate, where is the nearest police or hospital, how do I contact emergency services if I need them, and if in a foreign country, where is the nearest embassy? The Move Alert APP answers all of those questions by simply pressing the appropriate button and seeing the information you need. Further, you will be connected to local law enforcement and receive voice, data and video alerts informing you of adverse activities in your area. With your help we can provide this information not just to citizens who travel within their own countries but as individuals travel to all parts of the world the APP will immediately sync with the crime and Covid data in those regions.We are seeking a community of supporters that can provide feedback to us over the lifetime of this project as we seek to put this APP in the hands of over 1 Billion People World-Wide. Whether your donation is $1 or $10,000, you will join our flagship supporters program and will be given periodic updates about our APP as it expands from country to country.The Basic Move Alert APP will be provided FREE to every Citizen world-wide and includes all of the health and safety functionality. The Premium Move Alert APP will include all Basic features and additional communication features with expanded data for foreign travels.Another exciting feature of the Move Alert APP is that Schools, Communities, Cities, Law Enforcement Agencies and Governments can use a secure web based Communications Portal Page to direct message its Citizens using voice, data and video messaging. Created by Tierranova, LLC based in the United States with the support of  a local University and a local Technology Funding Group, the company worked with an India based Company to develop this APP for the past 24 Months. It is worth noting that the US and India are among the top 3 countries in the world with the highest cases of Covid outbreaks, which intensified the relationship of our two companies.The inventor, Ron Daniels, is a technology professional with over 30 years holds a Masters Degree in Engineering and is an expert in database technology and analytics. He initially created the APP to address the growing crime rates within the US in particular mass shootings. In 2020, the APP was upgraded to include Covid data as this pandemic affected the health and safety of all humans world-wide. He is passionate about getting the APP to all corners of the world because his life has been touched by both aspects of Crime and Covid, having lost a brother to violent crime at a young age and most recently losing his Father to Covid in 2020.",

There are no tips, so they’ll never go into your ear. That’s how they deliver superior sound in a natural, comfortable way. While many brands race to improve the noise-canceling and premium sound quality, designers have forgotten the most important part of any wearable technology - comfort & health. Check out this article from Whittier Hospital Medical Center about how traditional earbuds may damage your hearing and casue ear infection.What good are earbuds if you can only wear them for 1 hour before they make your ears sore - or worse, cause hearing damage and inner-ear problems?To change all of the pain points of traditional in-ear headphones, other open earbuds, or bone conduction earbuds. First, we believe the product should be a truly open earphone to achieve the best level of comfort, hearing protection, and transparent experience.At the same time, using your ears’ natural curves, a pair of powerful 16.2 mm drivers channel epic sound exactly where you need it —  leaving your ears open and never plugged. Let alone the unrivaled continuous playtime of up to 94.4 hours.Epic sound. True comfort. Together in an earbud at last.We did random street interviews at Toronto, Ontario in Canada. Let’s check out how people are reacting with our Oladance Wearable Stereo!We’ve sent out prototypes to experts in the fields of audio devices, technology, outdoor or sporting equipment, etc to give their professional and unbiased opinion on the features of our Oladance Wearable Stereo. Do stay tuned for more unboxing and review videos!Many reports have emerged about the risks of earbuds that go inside your ear – everything from skin irritation, to tinnitus, to long-term hearing damage. The Wearable Stereos avoid all these because they never actually enter your ear. There is no pinching of the auricle, no blockage of the ear canal, no pain or damage to hearing. So you can enjoy precision audio without worrying about ear discomfort.Chat with your running buddy while listening to Beethoven’s 5th symphony. Who says you can’t have both? Oladance keeps your ears open, so you’ll never lose track of what’s happening around you — whether you’re running down a city block, cycling on the road, or waiting for the airline attendant to call your row. Keeping you safe, while keeping you in the moment.The right fit, for all your moves. Molded to fit the natural curve of your ear, Oladance has a multi-point support system that spreads the weight of the buds evenly across your ear, eliminating sore spots. So you can wear them all day without discomfort. It also offers a stable fit that offers reassurance whatever the day brings.  The Oladance Wearable Stereos move when you do, and where you do.  So jump, skip, flip… Or just relax. And they are made with soft, skin-friendly silicone, easy to keep on even during your longest workouts. Your earbuds aren’t going anywhere. Plus, the Oladance features an extra-strong memory titanium wireframe, which has a certain degree of elasticity and can return to its original shape after bending. This means you won't have to worry about the inconvenience to put on your ear, or dropping one while you’re on the move. There’s a reason we call them the Wearable Stereos, not just earbuds - wearing them is like having a home stereo wherever you go. Oladance lets you feel that the sound is coming from everywhere outside in a natural way, a totally different listening experience with nothing blocking the ear. It's also a stereo that only you can hear. Oladance channels rich, full sound towards you and away from others. Two powerful 16.2mm drivers combine to bring you acoustic brilliance. With drivers three times the size of Apple’s Airpods, they create an audio experience that’s more like an intimate concert setting, and less like a pair of earphones. And the top bio-diaphragm technology offers a rich, consistent listening experience at any volume, from crisp and clear highs to excitingly powerful lows. Keep your bass tuned with Oladance’s virtual bass and dynamic EQ technology. Using automatic hearing compensation, they deliver even sound at different frequencies. Indoor and outdoor, providing a stronger sound quality experience at any time.Most bone conduction and other open earbuds place their sound unit at the top of the ear, resulting in a distance from the ear holes. We improved the structure to make sure the earbuds accurately cover the ear holes without going into them, cutting down on sound leakage effectively, maximizing the sound you hear, while minimizing what everyone else does.  You hear it all, while they hear nothing at all. Better conversations start here. The Oladance’s microphone system is designed to lift and amplify your voice while putting a lid on other ambient noise in the background. The patented environmental noise canceling (ENC) algorithm rebuilds the sound of your voice even when external noise threatens to stifle it. And with nothing stuck in your ear, your conversations feel natural, as though the person is right there next to you…Even when you wish they weren’t. Is that your boss calling?With the 160mAh large capacity battery, plus the breakthrough low-consumption algorithms patents, we optimize the battery life of the stereo to provide up to 16 hours of continuous play per charge for unbearably long flights or workouts that go all night.While the Oladance comes with a non-charging carry case, you can also grab an add-on charging case to extend the performance. With this large battery capacity case (2550mAh), the total playtime is extended to 94.4 hours! No need to recharge the case in 2 months if you use it for 1.5 hours a day. With the unbeatable battery performance and comfortable design, the Oladance is made to stay in place all day – even during those jump-rope sessions and backcountry cycling trips. Play and pause your music, skip tracks, adjust volume, and take calls — all with only a tap. The Oladance Wearable Stereos feature a touch control glass panel that puts you in control, so you never miss or press the wrong button even when you’re on the move. That means that whether you’re chatting with Siri or browsing your newest playlist, you can control everything simply by tapping your Oladances with one finger.As the product is such a unique innovation in every detail, we find it quite difficult to succinctly explain its advantages.  We hope this comparison table is helpful for our early supporters. Say what you want to say - without speaking a word.

In a way, it's kind of like hitchhiking, but much more safe because people have actual verified profiles with reviews. As a driver, input the location you are driving to, and you will see riders who are looking to go somewhere along the way. As a rider, input the location you want to go to, and you will see drivers in your location that have that route on their way. You can save common routes on your phone (like your house to the grocery store). This will be under the favorites setting. This app works on a points based basis. Everyone starts out with twenty free points. One point equals one minute of driving/riding time. For every minute you drive someone, you gain one point. For every minute someone drives you, you lose one point.Help people out by driving them to places that are already on your way, and people will do the same for you when you are in need of a ride. I am hoping that this app will encourage people to share rides and carpool more. They can meet people in a new place, or become closer to their own community by doing this. Also, there will be less traffic, and roads will be more safe. Less cars also means less C02 emissions, which means less air pollution. ",

Those designs are bulky, heavy, expensive, and designed for singular use cases. We’re applying exoskeletons to daily life, altering the way you interact with the world！Major tech media MUO highly appreciated the fitness mode of SPORTSMATE 5It’s easy. There are two powerful actuators at your hips on the exoskeleton. These provide assistance when you need to save energy and aim to go physically further, or resistance when your goal is training muscle. Two modes are designed for quick usage.         Outdoor Mode: Get easier for a long-distance walkingAssistance from the 2 actuators lift your legs and push them forward to make every step light as air. You will feel much easier while walking, going upstairs and uphill. Get rid of gulping air, sweating all over, and slow walking. Resistance in outdoor mode increases your stability by holding your body and absorbing the shaking while going downstairs or downhill. In a word, outdoor mode of SPORTSMATE 5 helps decrease strain & increase distance and lets you enjoy the fun of outdoor activities, like hiking, trekking, backpacking, even mountaineering!Fitness Mode: Burn More, Gain MoreHere is where our resistance actuators shine. Fitness Mode focuses on burning more calories and gaining more muscle strength in less time than a traditional workout routine. Resistance comes from different forms for our exoskeleton: extension and flexion. You are free to choose the resistance that fits your routine best for incredible results, for example, choose extension resistance while doing half-squats to train your gluteal muscle or use flexion resistance on leg raising training to strengthen the hamstring tendon.More applications with customized SPORTSMATE 5 accessoriesThe accessories can be quickly assembled to Sportsmate 5. After that, you can put on the device as usual and fasten the shoulder strap of the weight-lifting accessory. Then, the device can assist you in straightening your back up during weight lifting so that you can feel more accessible and decrease the risks of back injury.  While you are holding the weight and walking with that, our device will continually assist you based on our innovative algorithm of \"Holding condition\" & \"Walking Condition.\"  No weird feelings, and you can walk as usual.SPORTSMATE 5 has three subsystems: the gait controller system (central controller), the actuator system, and the energy system. In outdoor mode, your gait behavior will be detected by sensors and processed by our AI algorithm. Then the controller will send signals to the drivers so that motors can deliver appropriate assistance to you.In fitness mode, motors can provide different levels of resistance for burning more calories. Meanwhile, our intelligent energy system can harvest the energy from your movement and recharge the battery to achieve a longer duration.We've developed our innovative torque-based AI algorithm to adapt to complex environments compared to traditional exoskeletons, which used trajectory algorithms for medical rehabilitation purposes. More agile and flexible.   AI algorithm analyzes data from the motor encoder to detect the wearer’s gait behavior, providing precise torque support with every stride. Depending on the gait pattern, SPORTSMATE 5 can detect the user’s activity (e.g., hiking, jogging) and intuitively adjust the upper-level algorithm. The lower-level controller receives that reference and sends the proper signal to the motor drivers.Unlike traditional exoskeletons using high ratio transmission systems for patient stability, we implemented our quasi-direct actuator system, consisting of high torque density motors with low ratio transmission systems. Users can have more participation while in use without the traditional result of high mechanical impendence.     In terms of assistance, our actuator system can provide 50% of torque required by hip joints during a gait cycle for normal males.Our consumer wearable robotic exoskeleton uses adaptable rigid elements along the waistbelt to perfectly adapt to a wider range of body shapes.    To further fit the belt around your waist, an electric inflatable airbag fills the gap between your waist and the exoskeleton, providing better stability and more comfort.Single air pump inflation lasts for 10 seconds. Weighing in at just 2.5kg, the SPORTSMATE 5 is ultralight wearable robotics made for consumers. It’s composed of multiple high-strength composite materials including carbon fiber reinforced plastic and aerospace aluminum alloy.It’s compact form factor makes it easy to pack up and carry just as easy as it is to wear, taking about 1 minute to put on.In hiking mode, the battery provides steady and sufficient power output for different use-case scenarios. With our QDD actuation, less energy is wasted by the inconformity between use and device, thus achieving better sustainability.Depending on user movement, our smart energy system can harvest energy while in use. Going downstairs, training, hiking, and more can recharge the battery making SPORTSMATE 5 last even longer. We believe the future of consumer-friendly wearable exoskeletons is just breaching the surface. There’s so much more potential. To help further the application and development of wearable robotic tech, we’re providing a developer box with an extended interface with 2 UARTs, 8 DIOs, and 4 AIOs. You’re free to develop any application and run your own experiments. Welcome to the EXOSKELETON WORLD. We expect great things from you! Choose the size that fits your body most closely to get the best experience out of SPORTSMATE 5.We’re a startup that focuses on the research and development of exoskeleton robotics. We seek to improve the quality of life by providing people with accessible, user-friendly robotics that enhances mobility. After 4 years of research and clinical verification, we are launching our first exoskeleton, SPORTSMATE 5, dedicated to outdoor and fitness enthusiasts.  Leon Zhu, CEO of Enhanced Robotics, shows us how ER has improved the prototypes of SPORTSMATE in the past four years.We offer global shipping to anywhere in the world, and we've cooperated with carriers like FedEx, UPS, DHL, and USPS.

I recently became a life coach, and I am developing a Course at Mastermind.com to assist young adults who aged out of the foster care system, secured housing and employment but still need guidance to strengthen their confidence and independence to build a fulfilling life through simple mindset techniques, basic life skills and career mentorship. As I build this Four Week Course, I realize one of the most important factors to getting through this course is having an accountability buddy. I too have an accountably buddy as I continue my training and I know I could not have gotten this far without the accountability partner. So, this is where the idea of creating an app for finding an accountability buddy came about. Since I use this technique and the young adults, I will be coaching will also be using this technique I feel it’s a need for many. This app will help you determine what it is you are looking for accountability on and match you with another person looking for the same kind of accountability. The partners will decide how often they will need to meet virtually to go over what they accomplished thus far and what they intend to be accountable for next. The app will be used for goal settings, showing progress and reward system for completing tasks.Studies found that people who commit to their goal in front of another person are 65 percent more likely to achieve it, as reported by Entrepreneur.com. Likelihood of success rises to 95 percent when those same people commit to ongoing meetings with those accountability partners, to check in on their progress.I truly feel this is a necessity for the many who are trying to set goals and accomplish them. I think having a user friendly app to help with the process of finding and keeping an accountability buddy will help this technique thrive.",

                "Text": "PULSETRIO is the world’s first collaboration audio interface – delivering true production collaboration workflow, a digital audio mixer with three independent USB-C inputs, and the ability to synchronize production software across all connected devices, in real time. The most advanced audio interface devoted to improving collaboration and workflow between music producers.Designed as a compact 3in-1out audio interface with stereo analog output. Combined with a  software utility application for full control over hardware properties and synchronization settings.With 3 USB-C inputs, PULSETRIO also functions as a true digital audio mixer allowing for simultaneous listening of up to audio sources.  A  3 x 1/8 Headphone and 2 x 1/4inch main output connections give maximum audition versatility  whether working in the studio or collaborating on the road.This means you can use PULSETRIO as a standard audio interface with the ability listen to audio from all connected USB sources at the same time! PULSETRIO's patented technology consists of a single audio interface device with multiple USB-C inputs and a utility software application that interacts with the connected users' DAW application. Capable of connecting several computers with any of the supported DAW platforms and synchronizing them to each other, allowing real-time simultaneous collaboration.  As a result, all the users will be able to listen to their combined audio, and individual collaboration parts, while also being in sync with each other. This results in smoother collaboration with less time spent rendering files. Every modern producer has experienced the difficulties of collaboration in its current form. Its un organized, cumbersome and repeated rendering of files takes up valuable time that could be used for creating. As a result, its apparent a major challenge in modern music collaboration is the diversity of software [DAW] applications music producers use to create.  The PULSE utility control application allows for smooth integration of the hardware and DAW. Synchronizing with the controls on the hardware the utility application is a complete collaboration control center designed to synchronize music production workflow.PULSETRIO works natively with the latest version of FL Studio for OSX. Additionally, the device is compatible with many DAW programs that support MIDI external sync.Supported DAWs include: *Early bird units will be upgraded at no cost.PULSETRIO can be used in multiple configurations. Each port can connect up to 3 FL studio, 3 MIDI compatible DAWs, or a combination there of and efficiently synchronize their workflow. We have produced 30 working Early Adopter units that are ready to ship. However, due to worldwide chip shortages, availability and minimums, we need backers like you to be able to source enough components to produce our product in volume. We also want to give the opportunity for early backers to get their hands on a unit as soon as possible, as they help us shape the experience going forward.  We have ambitious goals to integrate not only OSX but windows computers into a universal workflow. With backer support we can  focus on windows development. We are also in preparation to begin development to natively integrate Ableton Live, another milestone in our roadmap. This and many other great upgrades and features are top of mind. We are a team of developers, software engineers and designers who have a passion for music.  Founded by Mario \"Wizzo\" Fernandez, Grammy nominated producer engineer and Co-Founded by Mark Seel, a firmware and software engineer [musician] with over 25yrs of experience in software architecture ranging from multi-threaded PC applications to low-power wireless communications firmware.*these updates will be provided to early backers at no additional cost. This product represents a long devoted journey to improve the way musicians create in a modern environment.  The good news is we've done most of the hard work. All that's left to do is the final production, and your funding helps us with this process. Funds will help us purchase components in bulk, keep cost down and will also help improve the software and hardware's compatibility with more DAW manufacturers and operating systems.With your support, we'll be able to start production and get PULSETRIO out to you quickly. Your contribution will help to fund:Traditional music sessions often involve live instruments, in which the brand, or manufacturer of the instrument is a non-factor to the instrument's ability to produce a tone in a group setting.  In current digital music production, laptops and computers have become instruments modern musicians use to create. Since there is no one-size-fits-all DAW, or Digital Work Station, music producers have a variety of choices when selecting a platform. Current DAW platforms all have a unique workflow, file structure and often completely different computer operating system compatibility . These differences in DAW platform, result and manifest themselves as digital barriers in the creative musical process.  Modern music producers are often handy capped when collaborating due to the difference in their music production software.  Contrary for example, a traditional musician would not worry about a Fender guitar not being compatible with a Pearl drum set when in a jam session.   Nowadays, music producers have to be resourceful to collaborate efficiently. Often having to use multiple audio interfaces,  audio mixers  and other clever ways to synchronize their workflow. More often turning into a situation where producers are detached, yet all somehow still working together. This workflow is counter productive to a free flowing synchronized collaboration session, where each user is collaborating from their own workstation.The concept for PULSETRIO was born in a real life studio session. Bitstream Audio founder and Grammy nominated producer engineer, \"wizzo\" collaborated along side multi-platinum producers, 'Mike Free' and 'LilJon'. All three participants had different DAW platforms: Ableton, Reason and MPC2 software. By a combination of  synchronized start button pressing, wireless transfer of files, multiple aux connections into multi-channel analog audio mixers, they achieved that which now you can do with one PULSETRIO.  The inefficiencies in music production collaboration and issues experienced that day, and many other sessions occurring all the time, paved the foundation that would become PULSETRIO. Conclusively, the need for a more efficient workflow was born from necessity to collaborate more efficiently. Thank you for your support!   We would be forever grateful if you would share PULSETRIO with your audience to help this project come to life!Multi-Input Digital Audio MixerDAW synchronization technologyPulse Utility ApplicationDAW Sync CompatibilityFL Studio – Native IntegrationAbleton - Native Integration in developmentReasonCubaseReaperNI MaschineMPC SoftwareIn the BoxPULSETRIOTravel CaseUSB-C CablesWe stand behind our products & services with confidence.

                "Title": "Web 3.0 - DWeb, DSM & DGames",
                "Text": "Before anything, I would like to mention that you have the option to follow on by reading the texts or watching the videos. I have tried my best to explain everything about Web 3.0, from its components to how it functions. Every topic has a headline, video and text, diving deep into the subject. I would recommend watching all the videos from start to end if you want to have a complete understanding of Web 3.0 and DWeb. Otherwise, the why section will explain the main reason behind this project. Thank you.In the early 2000s, with the introduction of Web 2.0, we began communicating with each other and sharing information through centralised services provided by large organisations such as Google and Facebook. We are always relying on these third-party giants to connect us. They are in control of our data in ways that many will not consider ethical. We must have the choice to control our data in sovereignty.With the introduction of Web 3.0, we look forward to an environment where no central authority, censorship and downtime exist. We will be able to log in anonymously and interact with each other using cryptographic (hack-resistant) methods.All of this can become true by introducing DWeb. A Decentralized Web will allow us to finally integrate Web 3.0 into our lives.Before explaining decentralization, we need to understand what centralization is. When a user wants to connect to another user or website, they will need to first connect to a server. A server is just a huge computer that manages clients' requests. The main issue here is that these servers may record every data sent or received. Another issue is that we are relying on this one server to manage everything. If the server were to stop working, the whole system will halt. A recent example could be Facebook's 6 hours downtime. In addition, these servers are the main reason we are not the sole owner of our data.Decentralization, on the other hand, does not depend on servers to operate. The network is known as a p2p network where users are connected directly and every user is also a server. As a result, instead of one huge server, the network has many small servers. Smart contracts will be used to achieve a p2p network structure. Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without an intermediary's involvement or time loss. ~https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contractsDWeb is the technical term used to describe Web 3.0. Decentralized Web (DWeb) is the infrastructure needed to gain from all the aforementioned benefits and build a DWeb browser, DWebsites, DSM and DGames.As already mentioned, DWeb will not be relying on servers/hosts to run.DWeb browser is the medium through which users will be able to access the DWeb and DWebsites.DWebsites or Decentralized Websites are websites that do not rely on a single server/host.After developing the DWeb, we will concentrate on building a platform for all users to upload their webpages and run a DWebsite as well. Users who run a DWebsite are called an administrator. They will be able to control their DWebsite through the DWeb browser. As a result, any person will have the chance to own a DWebsite by simply uploading files to the network, with a click of a button.With the development of DWeb, DSM will not be so far fetched. A social media with no downtime or censorship. A social media where you, as the user, are in full control of your data. With the use of smart contracts, users will be able to connect directly with no third-party interference. Imagine being able to share videos, pictures and messages in a decentralized network. For this section, we are planning on developing a page for content creators to share their videos, a page for sharing pictures and another page for sending messages (literally direct messages).Lastly, I should mention that DSM is going to be more global than the social media we are using today. I explained this in full in the Why section.Decentralization has many benefits but one of the most important ones for this section would be speed. Online games are usually slow and laggy because one server is responsible for many users' requests. In the case of DGames, with every user that joins the network, a server is also added. This will increase speed but we want to go a step further. We want to make sure that users do not face any lags at all, whilst playing. Users or in this case DGamers will download a huge chunk of the DGame onto their localhost/device and the rest will be streamed to play online. Instead of streaming large files such as pictures and sceneries, users will access them through their devices.  The difference in speed would be the same as the difference in downloading a video and streaming it. Therefore, the result should ensure a fast and smooth experience.We are planning on developing a DGame called Psur, which is briefly explained in the video above. Note: To develop the DGame, DWeb browser, DSM and Smart contracts, we will need to hit our stretch goals. More on this in the stretch goals section. Decentralization does come with risks as well. One of the most important risks is a lack of control over users' data. Although it is a benefit for users as it provides privacy, security and ownership, it may be misused in a way that puts other users in danger. Some users may see this as an opportunity to sell illegal products such as weapons. Meanwhile, they can stay anonymous and never get tracked. What's worse is that their data is immutable as well. To overcome such problems, we came up with a concept called DC or Decentralized Centralization! A group of people known as voters will be responsible for making the DWeb safe and secure. Any user who wishes to become a voter will have to be verified through a KYC verification. We will be responsible for verifying users, to ensure genuine voters. Hence the term DC. Nevertheless, what do voters do? Voters have the power to hide data or even a user. As mentioned, data or users are immutable, so voters can only hide content. The process is simple as well. Any user, not necessarily a voter, can report another user or his/her data. We as voters get notified of this report and choose between hiding, not doing anything and changing. When the majority of voters vote for the same option, then the change occurs. Otherwise, the reported content is considered safe. Note that, voters cannot change data/content but rather tags.DWeb ought to be global, so some may consider content to be ethical whilst others think otherwise. To address this problem as well, we will be using tags. Every content on the DWeb must have at least one tag attached to it, which summarizes the content. The tag can be a word or an emoji (you may watch the video for a better demonstration). These tags will then be used to separate wanted and unwanted contents. For example, some may consider alcohol as inappropriate content, so they will choose to filter out any content that has an alcohol tag attached to it. What if a tag is inaccurate?

                "Title": "Ketaiki: Wooden wireless phone chargers",
                "Text": "Hi hi everyone! And welcome to my first kickstarter!I am so happy to present my venture into kickstarter to make a self-designed useful item a reality.My initial idea with designing these chargers started from a simple starting point. I did not particularly like any of the designs I saw. So I set out to design and make my own!Design philosophy:I went into designing this with a few core design choices in mind    - It needed to fit into a bedroom or office environment   -  It needed to have a form factor which neatly holds your phone in place  -   It needed to be useable without much hassleFrom these choices came about 3 designs!Each design is manufactured using computer-controlled machining to maintain the single piece aesthetic. This also allows the freedom to design shapes which would be more complicated to achieve using more conventional manufacturing methods.Another conscious choice was that the user's phone is not supposed to lie on top of the platform, but in the device.And finally, the decision to use wood has allowed it to fit most interiors and rooms.The results are the ones you see below!The Standard type chargerThis design is the largest of the three.It has a recessed centre area in which you can place your phone. The gently sloping sides prevent it from sliding out, yet allow you to easily retrieve your phone out whenever so desired. The outer dimensions are approximately 28 by 18 cm (11\" by 7\") and will comfortably seat a 6.2\" size phone (my own) however I have made sure it will fit a up to a size 6.9\" phone without issue!The Angled type chargerThe next type came from the idea of having a design where the charging surface has a small angle, as to allow you to see your phone's screen from a sitting position.The charger also holds the phone in place with the raised edges, which eventually level out at the top of the charger.I was especially pleased when I received this make, because the wood gives such an unexpectedly interesting pattern!The outer dimensions of this type are approximately 19 by 9 cm (7.5\" by 3.5\") and will also comfortably seat a 6.2\" size phone however you can again fit a 6.9\" size phone without trouble.The compact type chargerThis final design came about after I was suggested to make a smaller version of my first design. I came up with the same phone platform size, however the edges are smaller in size, yet do not hinder phone accessibility.In terms of a smaller more space saving size, I was quite pleased to see how it turned out!The outer dimensions of this type are approximately 20 by 11 cm (8\" by 4\") and will, quite a shocker I know, also comfortably seat a  6.2\" size phone. It may not look like it, but I have verified that it will also seat phones up to a 6.9\" too! The circuitry and specsIt is of course good to know what to expect for performance of any device you have. Without it these would be more akin to bowls and less like chargers.As the charger is made of wood, a concern could be that wood does not mix with electricity. However, wood is an electrical insulator and will not conduct electricity. Also the charger is in use it may heat up due to use. However as the circuit board has a thermal cutoff, much like a computer does, and will power down for a while to make sure it does not damage itself in case it ever gets too hot!Dutch designThe idea of Dutch Design is to design something reflecting the Dutch spirit of innovation and creative thinking. The wood, parts, machining, packaging and components will be sourced from the Netherlands, allowing me to hold myself and my manufacturers to a high standard of quality. I always aim to make something I would want to use and see and by doing it this way I try to maintain this standard.The wood used for this project is multiplex, which resulted in the awesome pattern when machined across it's layers. I hope to eventually try other types of wood and get just as good results as these turned out! The USB port installed will be a USB-C port, as this standard will be the most commonly used in the forseeable future, and will be located on the short end of the charger.The arrows in the image below indicate on what side the USB port will be placed.And finally, I will have every charger marked with a serial number SPECIFICALLY for this kickstarter, so these will be distuinguishable from any subsequent follow ups!The nameTo embody the project I wanted to come up with a name which would be able to describe what it was, without being too on the nose. I came up with combining two pieces of Japanese to form the name. \"Ketai\" means cell- or mobile phone, and \"Ki\" can be written with the characters for tree, device or spirit. And when combining the former and latter part I had found my name!A little backstoryI went into this project with the intention of designing a charger which I felt would be a better result than the ones I've seen. After having scribbled a bit in borders and scraps filled with other work, I got onto using one of the most useful tools in my designing arsenal. The access to CAD software. The result of my first attempt into making a charger which would fit my phone, and hold it there with a recessed area might look very familiar!Now after the 3D model satisfied me, I got to translating this information to paper to make my first prototype!The first prototype I made started life as a stack of wooden slats. I cut those into smaller segments, glued them together and then cut and sanded the whole into a workable piece. (I was hoping the irregularities in the wood would create a nice pattern!). After that I went to work with my trusty dremel tool to cut out the shape of the segments to match the drawings. And while I wasn't fast nor totally accurate, it did actually work. You can see the actual circuitry for the prototype used in one of the pictures, which was later fitted inside. Also my first attempt at treating the wood was with a varnish. However I wasn't satisfied with that and have decided to use staining as a result!In this picture, you can see the result of the first attempt (Which was mostly proving that the charger would work fine through wood). And while it's not the prettiest, and the varnishing attempt didn't work out too well, I'm still quite happy I made it, as it was one of my first steps in this undertaking.The next prototype was much closer to the eventual design I decided upon. It is handmade too, but like the first prototype very much functional. The body is made from angled segments of wood with a flat top for the center area. It also has a small window which lights up blue when a phone is charging on it! However this may still change in the final design. It has the dimensions of the normal sized charger.Having handcrafted two functional prototypes, I felt so energized I tried my hand at making a few more designs. And as you can see below I've had quite some fun doing so! You can recognize which ones I've picked for this campaign, however maybe there is some future design I can work out too.After having made these extra designs I went searching for the possibility to machine the chargers from a single piece. And as it turned out I could! The resulting prototypes you can see here are the results from having them machined at a CNC shop, and I must say I was extremely excited to see the results. It was also really cool to see how the layers of multiplex revealed themselves because of the machining. This was the chargers when I got them from the shop, before the finishing and staining.I couldn't pass up the chance to line up a set of tries to show some of the evolution!And the look of the wood once it has been sanded and stained multiple times! Image and styleNow with the chargers so far along, I still needed something of a logo. Having thought of the name, I was given a few suggestions. Which I eventually narrowed down to two choices. And to find which one would best suit the chargers, had them engraved into wood, in a similar fashion as the serial numbers will eventually be! And for making this project look good, some nice pictures! The results should be recognizable in the various shots used in the presentation itself. Shipping and taxesSadly even over here we aren't exempt from the increased cost of shipping things across the globe. I've tried to find the most reasonable shipping I could find. As the constraint here for a small package is 2 kg, multiple chargers will not increase the cost up to this point. An extra heavy package will sadly jump the cost.I will ensure that every package has a track & trace code when shipped. As this in included in the pledge.Please do note that I take no responsbility for any import duties or fees which may occur in your country. Thank you all so much for reading up to this point and I hope I've had the chance to show you what this project is all about. Either which way, thank you so much for your time and I wish everyone a lovely time!",

                "Title": "Electronic Receipts",
                "Text": "Why do we still get paper receipts?When you purchase merchandise at retailers such as Target, CVS, Best Buy, Walmart, etc. you always leave with a paper receipt longer than a trip to the moon which more often than not you immediately throw away or lose. Did you ever think to yourself why in the digital age we are in today do we still use paper receipts to keep track of our purchases and for returns. Not only is it inconvenient when we try and return an item we purchased but it is also bad for the environment. Every year it is estimated that the United States ALONE consumes 3.3 million trees and 9 billion gallons of water, while emitting 4.6 billion pounds of CO2 in the process of paper receipt production. These chemicals don't just stay on the paper, but can make their way into our bodies as a result of simply handling receipt paper. My idea to change it all!What I would like to build here is an app that will allow generate and allow you to scan a barcode on your phone and get your receipt sent to it digitally to that app. Then from there be able to organize it by either store name, dollar amount, date, etc. within the app itself. I am not looking to create receipts within the app I want them to be digitally sent to the app just like how they are sent to your email at times. Your email gets too clogged this way and not every retailer provides that option. In the future I wish to have app features such as retailer coupons which can be claimed and clipped within the app. Many of these features will streamline your checkout process saving you time and money and helping the environment by cutting down on paper, ink and water waste.  My Goal!My hope and idea is to partner with the major box store retailers and credit card companies to gain access to the stores transaction detail and allow it to be uploaded right to the app and skip the paper receipt.Why Receipts are TerribleReceipts come from the lowest quality paper, and the ink may begin to fade few hours after printing in some cases. In many instances, the thermal ink will start falling off with time, and you will be left with a blank paper, so again why are receipts not digital?Thermal paper uses heat from a printer head to make letters and numbers appear; no ink is used. This process requires the addition of bisphenol A (BPA) or bisphenol S (BPS) in their \"free form\", which means that the chemicals are not bound to the paper or polymerized. The chemicals can easily transfer to anything a receipt touches your hand, the money in your wallet, or even the groceries in your shopping bag.BPA and BPS are known hormone disruptors that can affect brain development, heart, lung and prostate health, mammary glands, and reproductive abilities. They can be transferred from fingers to the mouth via food, or absorbed directly through the skin when held.Worst part about these receipts is you can't even recycle them they must be throw away in the garbage!!Apps and retailer with the right ideasSure a few retailers allow you to have your receipt sent via email such as CVS but this clogs your inbox making it difficult to filter and sort through all the junk you may have. All the apps currently available on the app store do not offer this service I wish and hope to bring to our society. The only services these apps provide are for you to take a picture and upload it after you've gotten your receipts or create a new receipt to give to a customer in exchange for goods or service. All these apps have very low star reviews and are old and outdated. I want to digitalize the receipt process for every single cash register there is at all businesses across America and then the world! Please help by donating today, if you aren't able to donate don't worry because the 2nd best thing is to share this! If you have any helpful insightful ideas then contact me as well. ",

During this critical time we believe we have the answer; Micro Freight.  Micro Freight is the process of taking a trailer of freight and breaking it down into smaller loads that can be carried by anyone with a vehicle and a valid drivers license.  To begin the process a shipper uses the App to indicate they have a Micro Freight Shipment that they would like moved either to a store, different warehouse or another location.  This load will be put onto the apps job board and anyone in the area that can complete the shipment within the shipper's  time frame can accept the load.  The load will have all the necessary details such as weight, size and much money the load will pay.  Once a driver chooses the load they would like to complete they reserve the load on the job board and arrive at the designated time.  Once the driver arrives they will need to scan in a QR code on the app to show they have taken possession of the Micro Freight Shipment.  After the driver delivers the Micro Freight Shipment to the designated location the driver will scan another QR code showing the load has been verified delivered.  Once all information has been updated into the system the driver will be paid within 24 to 48 hours.  ",

It could become a mobile app if we reach our 400% stretch goal (€88,000). Think of Play as a recording and production studio, with a large library of pre-arranged songs to choose from. Pick your song, record your part then match with other musicians from around the world. Create a Play together: a split-screen music video with the full song.As images speak louder than words here's a cool infographic for you to get a feel that we know what we're talking about... somewhat.And the good news is: Play is not limited to musicians. We wrote special arrangements with cups, rubber bands, hand-claps, voice and so on. Anyone is welcome to step onto the stage and share their love of music. You can create a Play with your friends, familly, pets... even if they don't play an instrument.Pick your mood.Pick your song.Pick your instrument. Or use your hands, rubber bands or anything you can find.Follow the notes and record yourself. Re-record yourself because the mic wasn't on. Re-re-record yourself because your dog barked. Re-re-re... Actually no, keep the one with the dog: it's cute!And voilà... Now other musicians can join your session and complete your band, you can also join other incomplete bands if you want.Go watch other Plays or share yours with the world on your favorite social media platforms.If we hit 100% we'll be able to offer 50 songs on Day 1.They’ve been carefully selected, ranging from modern hits by pop artists such as Taylor Swift or Sia to timeless classics like Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody. Each of them have been arranged for at least six instruments, including guitar, piano, bass, drums, violin, a lead instrument (clarinet, voice, flute…) and some non-instruments (plastic cups, rubber bands, hand clapping…). This instantly makes any Play sound very orchestral and gives our users the freedom to Play any way they like.If we hit our 200% stretch goal (€44,000) we'll be able to add another 50 songs, and the best part is that you get to choose them! If we hit 300% (€66,000), we'll add another 50 songs and offer a total of 150 songs for you to play with musicians around the world.Jellynote is a Paris-based startup made of passionate people who believe that playing music is as important as taking care of ourselves.Our motto: The more of us that Play, the better we all get. This is why we are building a space where everyone can practice, play songs and create music videos together.The creativity that flourished during the trying times that were *gestures at everything that has happened in the past two years* was also a big inspiration. Many \"stay at home\" concerts required video editing skills and musicianship way above the general knowledge possessed by mere mortals. We wanted to create tools that anyone could use without needing a master’s degree in film editing or a national orchestra at the ready.We’ve intimately witnessed how introducing more music has made our lives so much richer. You could compare it to a team sport: depending on where you live, finding a team to play with can be difficult, if not downright impossible.Play was created to address that by bringing musicians from all over the world together.To make Play by Jellynote a reality, we're offering you various rewards.On top of our everlasting gratitude, we're giving everyone pledging Player or above access to the app - before anyone else. You'll get to access our closed beta, but also enjoy the app's Pro features for free once it's released to the public.Each tier includes some limited-edition collector items, on top of the Player rewards.Conductors will receive a Play-designed conductor baton, as well as their favorite song in sheet music from the Play catalog, printed on a 40x60cm poster. Composers will be rewarded with their favorite song performed by professional musicians on a Play, in addition to the custom sheet music poster.Influencers will receive one of the most recognizable instruments in the gaming world - the ocarina - on top of the custom sheet music poster.We've got some digital rewards too:\nComposers will have the pleasure to attend our CPO's Masterclass \"Music is everywhere\". This masterclass will teach you how to find your music inspiration in the least suspected places, start making sounds with your coffee machine, or analyse the harmonies coming out of your teeth-brushing.Influencers will have the rare opportunity to ask Foolish Frankie (@foolishfrankie on Tiktok) for advice on how to become an influencer in today's world. The famous - yet lovely - musician (who plays all instruments at once in the trailer) could also teach you how to carve a pumpkin with saxophone reeds. But you might be more interested in how he manages to answer all the fan mail he receives and still finds time to play!For the most adventurous musicians amongst you (Influencers & Rock Stars), we are inviting you to our Parisian headquarters for the launch party planned in Spring 2022. But fear not, the composer pledge will give you access to the said launch party from the comfort of your home.We are a multi-cultural team united by our passion for music.",

You can significantly reduce costs if you already have some parts - you can use them with ease.You can achieve up to 40km on single charge - depends on how many battery cells you will use. The battery is easily removable.Maximum speed depends on you final configuration (motor power and wheel size). Currently it is up to 30km/hThe entire frame is easily adaptable to any changes that come to your mind.Note that in this type of project, the key is to adjust the proportions of the vehicle so that it is neither too big nor too small, and the position we take behind the wheel is as comfortable as possible. So if you would like to refine these sizes yourself, you have to spend a lot of time on it and make a lot of tests.So if you want to cut corners - I've already done it for you.Now anyone can take advantage of my work and build their vehicle based on the documentation provided.Vehicle can be constructed without any special tools, such as welders, migomats, etc.It is important, because not everyone has such devices and not everyone is able to use them. Moreover, these operations are rather time-consuming and this generates costs. Therefore, only bolted connections were used in this construction.It does not even require welding to the battery. Thanks to my special design you can built battery with ease.Non-standard parts, for example all connecting elements, folding mechanism, etc. can be done with 3D printing and laser cutting.You can easily order elements from 3D printing everywhere for very little money and probably some of you also have such printers at home.Laser cutting is also affordable and the services are easy available.You can also completely abandon laser cutting and cut each sheet and drill yourself.Even if you feel that construction is not for you, you can still support this project. With your support I will provide better documentation and then you can ask someone else to build it for you. Current specification:- weight: 11,4kg- top speed 30km/h- electric motor: BLDC 250W - front wheel 12 inch - rear wheel 8 inch with hub motorWhen recording tutorial, the scooter will be built from scratch based on new parts to show that all parts fits together perfectly. All parts will be 3D printed and laser cut. You will get 10 to 15 video tutorials and  more than 50 CAD files, all dimensions and a list of parts to buy.If it there is over funding - some new options will be also tested and recorded - different motors and wheels, different controllers etc.This license is for personal and non-commercial use only. If you want to sell this product, ask for a separate license - it's very cheap.",

Because the pandemic put in front of our eyes not only the professionalism of every healthcare staff but, first and foremost, that we are not only nurses but also human beings with the goal to guarantee the health and wellness of everyone.The pandemic has brought under a new light the role of nurses placing in the public eyes of our communities the existing criticality of this profession. In fact they are the first getting in contact with anyone in need of health care and they are the first encounters in the hospitals.Nurselife is a team of nurses with a keen to grow this profession.Our mission is to facilitate the learning curve, studying and preparing for the exams by contributing to improve the quality of health care. Within the app, you can find everything you need in regards to nursing. The topics covered are:- Basic and advanced nursing.- Critical care.- Maternal and Infant care.- Surgical care.- Management.The objectives of Nurselife are:1. Make available all sort of informative material for all the Italian nurses and not only, by translating to English, French and Spanish;2. Provide a positive change in the nurse role also from a social and cultural point of view;3. Simplify clinical care practice via an easy-to-use tool and clarity of contents;4. Help in review or preparation for university exams or for work.Nurselife, therefore, looks to the future with the respect and the teachings of a noble past which, across all its history, has shown the ability to shape the healthcare assistance, to manage it and to point it towards perspectives and solutions which they have been recognized only after years and years from their enunciations.And, as Florence Nightingale used to say, a nurse who, in the past, was already living in the future: “Caring is an art; and, if it is considered as such, requires a total devotion and a hard preparation, as per any work from a painter or sculptor; with the only difference being as to work not on a canvas or on icy marbles but on the human body.”.Do you study nursing? Are you freshly graduated? Or do you simply need a quick review while working? Nurselife is the app for you!! Help us growing and spreading all our knowledge not only for Italy but for the entire world.The app is already available in Italian:",

They are flexible and wearable, USB C chargeable and go with you everywhere. Party hopping, raving or taking the dog out at night,  Ravelights have a mode for it- Become part of the performance - Ravelights activley listen to your surroundings and use an advanced FFT algorithm to pick out the base notes in live music and beat to the performance.  Dance mode also works in every enviroment, from Huge Parties to Bluetooth Speakers.Solid Mode shines as bright as you, Ravelights shine bold and bright. A great mode for being seen whether you're walking around at night, cosplaying, using as stage decor or just want to be seen.  Ravelights do what they want with random patterns, waves and flickers, they have a mind of their own. Quick and Dirty Demo of Dance ModeRavelights have multiple clip on points to attatch them to things like belts, gear, jackets and you ❤️.Note, We Don't Actually Recommend Swinging Ravelights ;)Ravelights are Easy to UseOne button to rule them all. Hold to turn on, Hold to turn off, press once to change modes. In addition to this, we've added special functions. With a button command you can enable Night Mode and check Battery Percentage.Night Mode lowers the brightness of Ravelights in all modes. Keep the vibrant punch while saving battery power and the eyeballs around you. In dark environments in normal mode, Ravelights are really intense!Shipping Expectations And Where Are We Now?The engineering of Ravelights are done and we have already started manufacturing units. We are beginning shipping as many units as we can as soon as the campaign is done.Our current hurdle is manufacturing. We will be shipping early cases using additive manufacturing AKA 3d printing. The problem is output, this is slow and putting units together takes a lot of man hours. We anticipate on using funding to increase output and streamline the process. We'd like to move circuit board production elsewhere as well as move to injection moulded cases, but this is expensive! Once we overcome manufacturability, we can output significantly more units and then focus on new innovations like adding fully addressable RGB's and a few other incredibly cool feature's we aren't prepared to announce yet ;)We want to ship Ravelights ASAP! Our goal is to start shipping by ASAP and we are doing everything in our power to do so, although we have set our deadline to Feb 2022, we hope everyone's order is shipped WAY before this but hurdles may occur. If you're in urgent need because of an upcoming event, send us an email and we'll do our best to try and expedite your order. ❤️ Thanks for reading to the bottom",

                "Text": "Description: The application should be able to connect users with workers and help them find needed help with the occurred problem.Opportunity: A major problem in-home repairs and construction services is the lack of effectiveness of the system and the non-transparency of workers.Currently, there is a wait of up to three months for certain works, which is the problem for anyone in a living or a business place, which leads to high opportunity costs.The goal is to simplify and make home repairs and construction services more accessible.Solution: Imagine a person who has damage in a household or business facility. In the digital and modern world of service availability, we solve the problem that the user finds the desired handyman at a given moment through the application and solves a problem as quickly as possible. Here comes our application, which through geolocation at a given moment gives available workers and reviews of the same, history of their completed works and the reactions of the users of the application. The customers have the opportunity to choose the most suitable ones. The deal is settled within the same day, compared to the current long-term wait for repairs. FixIT offers a better relationship between the supply and demand of consumers and workers through an online system, as well as price competitiveness (wider choice of service).Secret Sauce: It currently takes a very long time to find a worker. Thus, the possibility of repair is extended and the user is in an uncomfortable situation of wasting their precious time and money. Here comes our application with the code used by various other applications that contain the geolocation and user database. It gives us a quick and easy way to choose the best and most affordable worker, while on the other side it gives the worker the choice to accept or reject the job application. This process improves the entire supply/demand relationship, speeds up the process and saves everyone time and care in finding handymen and consumers. Our main goal is to connect and save time for both parties.Users: Since repairs cover a wide range of jobs, our customers can be anyone who needs a specific home repair or construction service. The application is based on the smooth connection between consumers and handymen, where a quality and sustainable business model would be provided through a quality service fee model (advertising, monthly subscription or low fee when charging for the service provided). The goal is to cover a larger international market and become a global application for mediation between handyman and consumer. The target group is any person who needs repair.Thank you for your support!

                "Text": "The JC Pro Macro 2 is a USB keyboard device that emulates keystrokes and mouse movements, saving you precious computer interface time. A swappable Arduino-programmable ATMega32U4 Pro Micro (clone) powers it, and the board provides GPIO/I2C breakout pins for unlimited tinkering and customization.The keyboard/mouse combination is a fantastic general purpose tool for interfacing with a computer, which has nominally done the job for decades. But it wasn't made just for you and the way you work with a computer. The JC Pro Macro 2 adds an extra input device that can be customized to your liking for a huge productivity boost!Using the JC Pro Macro 2, without any add-ons, one could implement:...but you'll find many of those features in other macro pads. What's unique to the JC Pro Macro 2 is that it's:The JC Pro Macro 2 features a number of unique hackable features, including:Notably, the device is an enhanced-features sequel to the original JCPM, which has been successfully built and sold here.I made the first JC Pro Macro, as well as other experimental devices that came before, in a large part because I wanted a rotary controller for my computer. After many iterations, and inspiration from others, I finally have something that I'm willing to put up on Kickstarter. But why do I like mine? Why will you find yours indispensable? First off, being able to literally crank up tunes with an encoder knob and play/pause/skip songs with dedicated hotkeys is much better than mouse-based alternatives.I also personally love using this for editing video in Final Cut Pro X. The customizable shortcuts let me make quick work cutting clips free of sub-par content, and the encoder allows me to advance clips frame-by-frame. In fact, I produced this project's Kickstarter video using the JCPM 2. How recursive!Finally, being able to control the 5V PC-style cooling fan at the touch of a button is much fun. I can start, stop, or adjust a cooling breeze with a simple keystroke!Of course, you could use it for just about anything else: gaming, robotics control, home automation, video production, music production, CAD modeling, EDA, EDM (whether dance music, or discharge machining), video conferencing... In the above video, friend and prototype tester Pat Regan shows off some amazing Linux functionality: changing its lighting based on the program in focus, modifying external lighting, and working on video in DaVinci Resolve. Below, he's even shows off another JCPM set up as a CNC pendant! Much of what he's showing in the first video is beyond my Linux/home automation know-how–and will require user setup–but it demonstrates just what is possible with this hardware, specialized for tinkering and experimentation. Example firmware will be available, and the current (standard) version is found on GitHub. The device's functionality is still under development, and a nascent community is developing around this little board that you can be a part of!My background slants towards mechanical design and electronics, and I've put a large amount of time into developing what I consider a great looking and flexible platform:Hackable Electronics:Structural Elements Include:The knob comes in two formats: This isn't my first try at a macro keyboard. In fact, as seen here, a simple volume control knob eventually morphed into a 3D-printed device. This became a PCB-based original JCPM device that I have successfully used and sold, before settling on the JCPM2 design. Since deciding on this 8-button form factor, it has gone through multiple revisions.As of this writing, the device has been tested to work with Windows, Macintosh, Linux, and Raspberry Pi systems in a variety of situations.Of course, this is really just scratching the surface of what's possible with it. I'm looking forward to seeing what people do with it!Programming and customization are via the Arduino IDE, and it can theoretically run QMK firmware for custom layouts without Arduino knowledge. Preliminary testing with QMK has been successful, and full functionality can hopefully be developed further.I'm Jeremy Cook–The \"JC\" in \"JC Pro Macro,\" an engineer who simply can't help making new contraptions. After several auxiliary input devices, I'm proud to present this one for crowdfunding. You can see more of what I make and do on:Also, a big thanks to those that helped make this possible:While this is my first Kickstarter, this is not my first time selling custom electronics online. I've delivered well over 200 items from my highly rated Tindie store.Additionally, I spent a decade in manufacturing automation, making me intimately familiar with the processes needed to create many copies of one device. When in charge of manufacturing lines, failure is not an option, and I hope to bring that experience and attitude to bear here. If and when help is needed, I have a wide range of contacts that I can call upon, especially if funding and demand becomes abundant! To that end, I hope you will support this project's goal, and that I can ultimately provide you with an awesome computer input device.After testing the JC Pro Macro Original, along with a JCPM2 prototype for several months, I've had a chance to work with it, and morph it into something that works really well.PCBWay was used to manufacture the various prototype iterations of the device's main board, and has even agreed to a discount on the final product in exchange for mentioning them here. They've always delivered in a timely manner, so I'm quite confident in this aspect of the project. I also plan to use their matte black finish on the boards, which I think looks awesome.More info on the JC Pro Macro Original can be found here on GitHub, and code etc that can be used with the JC Pro Macro 2 will be stored in this repository as it develops. While the prototype device is currently functional, its final form may change from what is shown here. To be clear, what is shown in the videos here is possible with the device, but much of that functionality will take external hardware and/or software to set up. You currently need to use the Arduino IDE to change key functionality around. If you enjoy that sort of thing, I think you'll love it!Project by Jeremy Cook Consulting LLC",

The idea for Ventus Home and Ventus Ion all started when I was living in Hong Kong. I realized the poor indoor air quality was affecting my 7-year-old son, so I began to research the contributing factors of indoor air pollution. I learned that in addition to outside air pollution, home scent products are a major contributor!Since I had expertise in developing commercial scent systems, I realized that I could combine air purification and scent diffusion to provide a better way for people to enjoy fresh air and clean scents.I assembled a team of scent industry experts, put pen to paper, and started working on developing Ventus Home and Ventus Ion along with safer fragrances. We came up with the world's first and only hi-performance home systems that purify the air and distribute natural fragrances throughout the home. It’s smarter, eco-friendly, and affordable to use.We can’t thank you enough for checking out our project and helping us make Ventus Home and Ventus Ion a reality.We know not everyone will be able to support us with a pledge, so even if you can’t give a dollar or pre-order a Ventus Home or Ventus Ion, you can help us spread the word on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram and anywhere else you can think of!",

                "Text": "Hello,\n Imagine that you are in the middle of nature while camping, or you are walking with your family in the woods, or you live in the countryside,\n\n For you, we offer three applications for smartphone and PC that allows you with your smartphone or a simple camera or camcorder to identify in real time trees or plants.\n These applications will help your teenagers who spend their day on their smartphone to love nature!\n\n These three applications have one thing in common: there is no need to have a network so if you plan to move to a cabin in Alaska these applications will be very useful,\n These apps all have the same goal: to learn more about nature and appreciate its benefits, to show you why to preserve it.\n\n Whether you live in the city, in the country, by the sea or isolated without civilization more than a hundred milles away, the first application is made for you, it can save your life or help you to treat your little boo-boo.\n This application allows you to identify in real time medicinal plants and to give you their usefulness. Like the chelidonia which treats warts with its sap, the wild thyme or the plantain which helps to relieve respiratory problems,...\n\n Whether you are an amateur or professional gardener, the second application is for you, it identifies the diseases that can be found in a vegetable garden and gives you a solution to eradicate it. For example, mildew can be treated with horsetail manure or a mixture of baking soda and black soap...\n\n The third application is for anyone who wants to know a little more about trees, those who want to know about edible fruits or berries and also for forestry professionals\n Whether it is fruit trees or trees of our beautiful forests.\n It allows to identify trees from their leaves, their fruits or their trunk,\n For example the oak with its leaves and acorns, the hazelnut tree with its delicious nuts...\n\n These applications are compatible with Android smartphones, IOS smartphones and PCs or tablets under Windows,\n\n It will be possible to record the GPS position, this feature will be very useful to find a plant to treat you from one year to another,\n\n The names of the plants/trees will be given in English and French, but it will be possible to give your own names according to your language or customary name, via a configuration file,\n\n Garonix is a startup created in 2017 with the objective of making a revolutionary machine for the production of electronic boards with real-time recognition of the position of electronic components in vac. The project was stopped because it was too far ahead of existing technologies and in particular because of the slow learning of neural networks.\n The creator of Garonix has 20 years of experience in industry, he is an electronic engineer at the base, but has skills in mechanics, electricity, low and high level computing, so technical above all.\n We are not a big team, we could have taken a picture of a meeting of friends by giving them a jersey with the same logo as some do on this site ...\n\n If you want some particular plants/trees to appear in the first release, you can send us your request with at least 50 pictures (leaves, flower, fruit, trunk, general appearance, small, medium and large size and if there are plants/trees that look like but are not the ones you want) per plant you want\n\n Why we ask for money in Kickstarter:\n -To validate the development of the applications by asking your interest, a kind of market survey.\n -To buy a big computer to make the learning of the neural network which is very greedy in resources and time.\n The experts could tell us to use the Google servers which propose in rent by the hour of the servers to make the training, but as everyone knows Google is a trader before all, the confidentiality for Google does not mean anything, it is placed above the states and the laws...\n\n  Please note that the designer is not responsible for the use of these applications.\n The data provided will be extracted from the internet or provided by an amateur, they are given as an indication, the user is the only one responsible for the possible consequences of their uses.",

                "Text": "Our goal for OpenXCT is to create the most accessible and customizable X-ray computed tomography machine on the market.During development, we reached out to the research and engineering community to fully understand the XCT users' needs. We quickly realized that users face challenges with the cost and practicality of available hardware systems and access to the underlying software. OpenXCT uses swappable mechanical components and open software so our users can take full control of their devices. To date, OpenXCT is a working prototype, constructed from 8020 extrusions and aluminum plate.Even with the prototype system, we have completed several high-resolution scans that match the quality and resolution of other industrial machines. However, the device needs improvement in consumer aesthetics and mass production practices before a full product release. With that in mind, we are moving towards the production of our final device, we have already designed our aesthetic and production improvements, and are moving closer towards our inaugural product launch! With the help of our Kickstarter backers, after carefully considering cost, availability, and practicality, we are seeking to launch the next iteration of OpenXCT.OpenXCT is compact enough to fit on your desktop and flexible enough to fit a range of needs, thanks to modular features and open-architecture software.We designed OpenXCT with price in mind, using durable, replaceable, and interchangeable hardware.This means:Mechanical SpecsOpenXCT’s modular hardware and open architecture software combine to form a system capable of scanning any subject while maintaining a reasonable price.Other compact XCT machines are much bulkier, with most around the size of large kitchen appliances. Here’s how OpenXCT can fit into your space:How it works:1. Subject   →   2. OpenXCT Device   →   3. Reconstruction1. SubjectsSubjects constructed from various materials and ranging in geometric shape, size, and complexity can be selected for nondestructive inspection of both internal and external features.2. OpenXCT DeviceOnce placed into the OpenXCT device, 360 degree X-ray projections of the subject are acquired. OpenXCT adapts to any subject or imaging needs by allowing adjustable X-ray power, max scan size, and imaging resolution.3. Reconstruction AlgorithmsOnce the scan is complete, built-in reconstruction algorithms (such as FDK and 3D SIRT) or custom user-scripted algorithms process the 360-degree scan data. The subject reconstruction can then be analyzed using the OpenXCT web-based data visualization tool.Computed tomography has been available since the mid-1900s and is proven as an essential technology for inspection and research and development.With its long-time history in numerous industries, why is the technology still so expensive?OpenXCT’s starting price is many times lower than the competition, including other compact CT devices as well as industrial CT machines.OpenXCT uses more widely available technology to decrease unit price while still maintaining the features and functionality found in more expensive offerings. At its revolutionary price point, OpenXCT makes XCT technology significantly more affordable and accessible to an unprecedented range of users.There are many types - or modalities - of X-ray imaging procedures, each of which uses different technologies and techniques. OpenXCT incorporates several X-ray inspection techniques into a single device1. 2D Radiography: An imaging technique used to view the internal form, and materials, that make up an object. 2. Internal Inspection & 3D Tomography: OpenXCT obtains 2D radiographic images 360 degrees around a subject, then combines and reconstructs them to produce cross-sections at any angle through the subject.3. 3D Reconstruction & Surface Metrology: In addition to viewing 2D slices of a subject, OpenXCT is also capable of combining the slices to create a 3D representation of the scanned subject. This produces a 3D representation of all external and internal subject features.X-ray source:Our swappable X-ray sources optimize X-ray voltage and amperage for use with various subject materials and thicknesses:4-50kV:polymers, wood, and lightweight bone60-90kV:composite, electronics, and medium-density bone100-120kV:concrete, ceramics, and dense boneProjection Imaging and Resolution:Standard 5.1 Megapixel resolution and 1x optical zoom can be upgraded to increase imaging resolution and the smallest detectable feature sizesDetector Size:Available detector sizes range from 8″x8″ to 24″x24″Environmental Commitments:OpenXCT uses long-lasting design and replaceable parts, encouraging the replacement of individual parts instead of still-in-use equipment. This way, the user can scale and swap parts of their device to suit their needs while preventing unnecessary waste.We began OpenXCT as a small project in July with the goal of making XCT more accessible. We have since brought on a team of engineers, designers, and other industry professionals to help further develop and expand OpenXCT. With your additional help and funding, we look forward to continuing the goal of creating an affordable, open-source XCT machine.",

                "Text": "Printing food is an interesting idea, but the food 3D printers on the market are too expensive. What we want is a flexible solution for food 3D printing, so we create LuckyBot - a replaceable 3D printer extruder. You can easily install it on your original 3D FDM printer, and print food in the shape you want in a flexible & affordable way.Not everyone could cook like a Michelin star chef, but what if we bring the 3D print technology to your kitchen? You can print all the exquisite desserts with your 3D printer, easy same as you use it to print filament.That's why we create LuckyBot. It is compatible with most of the FDM 3D printers on the market. Just take a few minutes to install, then you can have a food 3D printer at a small cost.LuckyBot is designed with a perfect size that is enough to fit most of FDM 3D printers on the market and utilize the printing size of the original 3D printer to allow you to print bigger size models.Only 675g weight makes it fit your FDM 3D printer and not exceeding the limits of the motor's capacity.1.  Remove the original extruder2.  Replace with LuckyBot3.  Connect LuckyBot and original 3D PrinterLuckyBot Installation Video Based On Creality Ender-3 3D Printer:Three buttons to handle temperature control, lead screw adjustment with ease, no matter you are a professional or newbie, it only needs few minutes to get started.As for the software part, you can follow the same procedures as you print filament to operate LuckyBot.LuckyBot supports the printing of a variety of ingredients for any model you create, so you have more choices and more creativity. Whether it's an expensive ingredient like chocolate, or a widely available ingredients like jam, cream, mashed potato, salad sauce, etc.We've tested various major brands' 3D printers to make sure that LuckyBot could be installed on most of FDM 3D printers.LuckyBot can be installed on:What makes LuckyBot unique is the technology inside. With our years of development, it has better temperature system, motion control system, and advanced circuit control system. You can print more complex and precise objects than using other food printers.The temperature is the most important factor when we print food. With the advanced temperature control algorithm, we have improved the temperature control accuracy within ±0.5℃.Food is different from filament in many physical properties. We will need a better motor control system to print food with the same accuracy.LuckyBot is designed for food printing. Safety is the priority when we design LuckyBot, and all the materials are food grade. However, to make it could be used by everyone, we have enhanced the safety in power supply and temperature control. We ensure all ingredients completely sealed and do not touch the outside world during the whole printing process.LuckyBot will automatically stop heating when open the door.Unlike the normal FDM 3D printers, which use filament as materials, needing a higher temperature to print, LuckyBot works under a much lower temperature (≤40℃ ).Founded in 2014, with the focus on education, food, scientific research, and manufacturing, Wiiboox has been always committed to be a global leading supplier for 3D printing integrated solutions. We are a professional team integrating the department of design, R&D, manufacture. Our purpose is to provide affordable, high-quality 3D printers to different kinds of customers. So here we are, present our latest creation – LuckyBot, an affordable food extruder for FDM 3D printer.",

                "Text": "Although the variety of sensors and actuators is almost unlimited, they can all be grouped in three categories, based on their electrical interfaces:1. Serial communication - RS-485 is the dominant choice, due to its ability to support multiple devices with excellent noise immunity at long distances.2. Digital inputs and outputs - From find simple switches, contacts and pushbuttons, to any circuit which can be powered by a relay.3. Analog inputs and outputs - Temperature, pressure, humidity, level, position, light and other sensors. Motors, linear and rotary actuators, and many many other devices have analog inputs and outputs. The industry standards are 0-10V and 4-20mA current loops.Raspberry Pi is a powerful and inexpensive programming platform, but it cannot connect to the physical world without additional hardware. This project brings to Raspberry Pi all the common interfaces needed to connect to the automation world:Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways. It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to design flows using nodes from a large library covering a wide range of automation tasks.Learning Kit native Node-RED nodes included in the repository make it easy to interface with the hardware.The Learning Kit Card needs 5V/50mA to operate with the relays off, or 200mA with both relays on. It is powered from the Raspberry Pi through the GPIO connector.  A Raspberry Pi power supply able to provide minimum 3A is recommended.The Card contains a standard RS485 transceiver which can be accessed by the serial port of the Raspberry Pi. MODBUS protocol can be run on Raspberry Pi to access industry standard sensors and actuators.Pluggable connectors ease connecting the card to external devices.  All the connector plugs are included in your kit.Nine LEDs on the bottom edge of the card show you the status of the inputs and outputs. The leftmost LED shows when the power is connected to the board.The next two LEDs, labeled IN1 and IN3, show the status of the corresponding opto-isolated digital inputs.The middle four LEDs are general purpose. They can be connected in software to show the status of any input or output. They can also be programmed to light at a certain input or output level. For example, you can learn how to turn on a LED when a temperature reaches a threshold. You can also blink a led slower when a temperature is relatively low, and faster as it approaches a preset limit.The two rightmost LEDs are routed to the corresponding relays and show when the relay coil is activated.Zero to 10V Input can be used to sense voltage levels from devices such as thermistors, humidity sensors, or photoresistors. Zero to 10V output can be used for actuating industry standard devices such as lighting controller.Widely used industry standard 4-20mA current loops can be used to control remote devices over long distances with high noise immunity.A pushbutton is provided to be able to add manual input to any system. The button can also be used by Node-RED or other Raspberry Pi programming in an arbitrary manner.  The first Tutorial lesson gives some examples from saying \"Hello World\" to sending SMS or email messages.The Motor port can drive a 5V/100mA DC Motor. You can learn how to control the speed and the direction of the motor from the command line, Python or Node-Red graphical user interface.See Update #21. Raspberry Pi Learning Card 2. Connector Plugs 3. Brass standoffs, screws and nuts 4. Self Test Loopback Cable1. Command Line Interface2. Python Interface3. Hardware Schematics4. User's Guide5. Node-RED TutorialThe optional Add-on kit contains six cable assemblies which let you experiment with the I/O interfaces of the Learning Kit. The Node-RED tutorial will have ample description of each interface, teaching you how to interact with it without writing a single line of code. Command line and Python drivers will also be available for each assembly.  Simply plug in the accessory plug into the corresponding port and run the software1. ON-OFF-ON Switch. The switch can be used to read the contact closure inputs.  2. Thermistor.  The thermistor can be used to measure ambient temperature using the 0-10V input.  3. Photoresistor. The photoresistor will let you measure light. You can use it to turn lights on at dark, to see when somebody enters a room, or for any application which needs light. It can be read also with the 0-10V input. 4. Potentiometer.  Used also with the 0-10V input, the potentiometer will let you simulate the analog output of a sensor which you can display in Node-RED.5. RS485 Temperature and Humidity Sensor.  Plug it into the RS485 port for data, and the 4-20mA port for power, and use Node-RED to interface to it.6. Micromotor. Plug it into the MOTOR port and control the speed and direction from Node-RED.In addition to the I/O Learning Kit, you will need the following:1. Raspberry Pi. The Learning Card will work with any Raspberry Pi version 3 or 4, but we recommend using the latest (4). Make sure you get a power supply and an SD Card. If you have never programmed the SD Card, you should get it pre-programmed for the Raspberry Pi of your choice.2. USB keyboard and mouse.3. Monitor or TV with an HDMI port.4. DVM multimeter.5. Optional IO Accessory Add-on KitThe I/O Learning Card can be self tested with the loopback cable included in your kit. The Loopback Cable can be plugged into corresponding connectors on the opposite sides of the card. After inserting the Test Cable in one of the four possible positions, you need to run the Self Test command  from the command line, or from Node-RED.1. Test digital inputs IN1 and IN2 using RELAY-1.2. Test digital inputs iN2 and IN4 using RELAY-23. Test 0-10V-IN port using 0-10V-OUT4. Test 4-20mA-IN port using 4-20mA-OUTAll the analog inputs and outputs are calibrated at the factory, but firmware commands permit the user to re-calibrate the board, or to calibrate it to better precision. See the User's Guide for calibration details.The Tutorial will help you use the Learning Kit with Node-RED without writing a single line of code. It will show you how to use Node-RED to control each of the interfaces of the Learning Kit. It will start by building simple flows using the pushbuttons and the LEDs and advance to the point where you can control devices over the internet. You can start learning Node-RED today without waiting for the Learning Kit. You will start by sending \"Hello World\" greetings to your screen or your speakers, and advance to sending emails and SMS messages to your smart phone.CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FIRST THREE CHAPTERSRaspberry Pi add-on teaches Node-RED I/O programming",

Think Spotify x Facebook x Patreon x Tinder (for music, not love!). Bubl's design means that music tracks / videos, photos, videos, events, tickets, merchandise, live streams, group chats, fan content and more are all under one 'roof'. No more switching between different applications to find that song you wanted to share with your friends, no more missing those important releases or announcements. For artists, there's a free platform for exposure to global audiences, versatility in how you make your music available and new ways to engage with your fans. On top of that, we pledge to put more in your pocket with unique, innovative revenue opportunities. It's time music fans really had something to sing about!Let's start with our mission statement:In early 2021, Bubl was born; largely out of frustration. Frustration at the lack of a centralised app for all your music needs, and frustration with music streaming and social media platforms. Regardless of what tech companies developed, finding new music, supporting your favourite artists, and connecting with fans of the same kind of music we love wasn't easy and meant switching constantly between several apps. Meanwhile, artists are seeing their revenues cut, promotion only seems to go to the top 1% and social platforms have become hotbeds for hate and vitriol. And the owners of these existing platforms? Well, they seemed to be getting richer off the very artists (and rights holders) who are often struggling to make ends meet.At Bubl, we believe it's time for change; time to better look-after the music we love and cherish so much. None of us at Bubl want to be billionaires and we aren't looking to exploit artists in the pursuit of wealth. Our business model reflects this, and has been designed and created to ensure as much of the money from sales and streams goes straight back to the artist. Discovery mode generates NO revenue for Bubl; we don't charge artists or listeners, nor will you find adverts. It is simply a product born out of desire - the desire to make connecting artists and new fan bases less challenging. We have spent the past 6 months designing, specifying, and planning this project meticulously. It's hugely ambitious. But so are we.Headquartered in London, and with remote offices in Brighton and Serbia, Bubl was founded by music lovers and technology industry 'veterans' who are passionate about creating better opportunities for music fans and artists alike. With backgrounds in social gaming (EA, Warner Bros, Microsoft, Zynga), artist management, TV / broadcast and development of live music streaming platforms (one of our team built the Apple iTunes Festival streaming service) and dating / community tools, we have the tools, skills and know-how to deliver what we believe will revolutionise music streaming and social media. For more information about the leadership team, please visit our LinkedIn Page: Bubl on LinkedIn At Bubl, we chose to launch on the Kickstarter platform for two main reasons: 1) The Kickstarter platform gives us access to a global, engaged audience of early-adopter consumers looking for the next big thing. Our team and our supporters believe Bubl can change how we consume, share and support music for the better, and we think the Kickstarter platform is a good place to find like-minded folks.2) By raising funds via Kickstarter, we are able to retain our independence and engage in a meaningful way with our backers. This seems particularly relevant in the context of music, but we want to only answer to the community we pledge to serve and support; no external bias from investors or those with an interest beyond supporting ALL artists. The money raised through this campaign will be used to pay for the following:Beyond our £350,000 goal, we have stretch goals which will expedite the development and release of future 'modules'.

This allows music fans to purchase Bubl Credits from the app store and enjoy all premium content. Last but not least, fans can now get even closer to the artists they love with Artist VIP Passes. Gain access to exclusive content as well as early access to new music, gig tickets, merchandise, live streams and more. For Artists Bubl gives artists and rights holders multiple ways of hosting music, as well as the opportunity to earn industry leading royalties. This flexibility gives less-established artists further opportunities to grow their audience easily and for free. VIP Pass brings a new revenue opportunity and genuine ways to reward your most loyal fans. Give VIPs early access to music, merchandise and tickets, access to your exclusive content such as tracks, interviews, music videos, rehearsals, live streams, Q&As and more. YOU are the artist, YOU are in control.   *Subscription launch TBC** Access to artist catalogue via VIP Pass dependent on rights holders permission. Built for the global music community, Bubl is designed to bring like-minded music lovers, artists, fans, labels, venues, music instructors and more together to discover and share new music, to support musicians, and to help better plan events.Bubl makes the sharing and celebration of music safe and easy, while providing artists a meaningful way of growing and engaging with a global fanbase.Bubl provides new, unique revenue streams for artists and increased royalty payments for rights holders.JukeBox (Pay per play)Rights holders will earn a penny per stream* via Jukebox mode.

The Design is Made in Italy, the peculiarity also lies in the design that allows it to be used also as a wake skate or snow skate, moreover from this year Psykoboard has an added value: we have created the stick / handlebar, to transform it into a perfect scooter.It can also be used when it rains and with puddles, as its peculiarity is that it is the first electric skateboard in the world with integrated splash guard, that is, you do not get wet when riding in the wet.\n It is a perfect SMART MOBILITY.\n The electronic system and electric motors are completely waterproofed since the motor is housed inside the wheels, with a cooling system and self-regenerative braking, to recharge the Li-Poly battery.\n A comparison with the internal electric brushless wheel motors, and the brushless motors of other existing electric skateboards, Psykoboard's motors generate less heat, are protected from dust and water (waterproof level IP65), with better performance, efficiency and reliability, therefore safety. at the top.\n The two brushless wheel motors guarantee an acceleration of starting torque and formidable climbing performance (climbing grade 25%) and the drive wheel tires are replaceable.\n The lightweight battery can be quickly replaced without any problems.\n Psykoboard skateboard is controlled by a remote control with excellent ergonomic design of modest size, it has multiple functions, such as two speeds, including normal and sport. The remote control directs forward or reverse gear equally. Due to this peculiarity Psykoboard can be used to drive with front or rear wheel drive depending on the needs being a \"Twin Tip\".\n The Psykoboard skate comes with a replacement tire for the drive wheels, battery charger, battery, rechargeable remote control and key to adjust the trucks.Last year we had the honor of participating in a small appearance of the wonderful film \"La Vita davanti a sè\" by Eduardo Ponti with the great Sofia Loren who had an Oscar, golden globe and David di Donatello nomination.\n PSYKOBOARD has all safety certifications such as: CE, FCC, RoHs, MSDS, UN, 38.3.",

                "Title": "Samurai 120 CNC Machine",
                "Text": "We are back! After our last 2 Kickstarters failed over a year ago we went away and grew our Instagram page and continued to work on improving the machine.We currently have a few generous people who have decided to spend over double the normal price on a machine just to help get us started. Thanks to their efforts we have already raised a total of £35,000! We decided to do a kickstarter because there may be other people who want to join in on the initial funding and any more sales will help us reduce the cost to manufacture and increase our chances of success.If you would like to pay extra for an early machine please contact us first.For a long time Tormach and Taig have been the well know providers of small hobby cnc machines. We think its time for change.While these two companies aim to provide beginner friendly, high quality, hobby machines, and do a great job at it, we want to sell a low cost, mini vmc.Also lots of people are wasting time and money on their 'DIY CNC' or 'CNC Conversion' and we want to stop that. It sounds exciting at first but halfway through you realise that its going to take much more time and money than you expect and the result won't be as good as you expect.We want to make a machine so affordable and desirable, that there is no reason to attempt a DIY CNC anymore.Its basically a manual milling machine that you can convert to CNC by adding steppers and electronics. It can be shipped as a kit or mostly assembled so you can still get to experience the fun part of making your own machine. Assembling the machine yourself has the added benefit of teaching you how it works so if something needs to be replaced later, you will know exactly what to do.The idea for the CNC Conversion kit actually came from a YouTube comment on our video. We think its a good place for us to start because there are few things to go wrong compared to making a complete vmc. It will also be the cheapest option and we want everyone to be able to experience this machines capability.This machine will cut practically any material a large VMC will cut, its just a question of how fast.Below shows a production run I did of 100 airsoft gun parts in 7075T6 aluminium. This kind of job is normally left for the big VMC's to handle but this machine did it.It took 7 minutes to rough out each of these parts, the final weight reduction was 80%.We have tested this machine with hundreds of parts over the years, check out @izenengineering and @samurai_machine_tools to see just some of the parts we have made.There have been stressful times where I was late with an order and had to rough twice as fast to get it delivered the next day and this machine always just gets the job done. You can count on this machine for when it matters. Its earned its VMC title for that.CNC machining has the potential to make you a lot of money. Whether you offer a service where you machine other peoples parts or you manufacture your own products at a fraction of the price, you could make a living with a machine like this. Now I'm not gonna pretend that you could pay for this machine in a day, or a week or even a few months, especially if you are new to this, but if you are willing to put in the work it will be possible.Unlike most DIY CNC's, you can be confident that the Samurai 120 will perform exceptionally, and will not suddenly stop working, which is crucial when using a machine to make money.We know the struggles of using stepper motors so all our machines that include motors use JMC servos. They are tuned to optimise performance and improve crash safety.Servos don't ever lose steps, and if they lose position (due to a crash) they send an alarm signal to the controller which e-stops the machine. They are also silent.Protecting the motion components is one of the most important aspect of any metal cutting machine. Leaving ballscrews exposed to metal chips will very quickly destroy them and give you low quality parts.The prototype machine has accordion way covers on the Y axis and they work ok but its a bit annoying having to clean them constantly. For me it is not acceptable to sell a product that has an inherently annoying aspect so we are using covers with stainless steel shields.We will be using Mach 4 on all our CNC machines because it is the best software that runs on Windows in our experience. Mach 4 gives us the option to write our own scripts and design custom UI without having to spend thousands developing our own software.Newfangled solutions also offer great support which is crucial to selling a CNC machine.We spent years looking for a motion controller for this machine and couldn't find one that was good enough so we are developing our own with the help of PoLabs. This machine has been through hundreds of iterations over the years. I used this machine for a job shop business so any time there was something I didn't like, I would change it. I repeated that cycle for years and thats how we have ended up with an exceptional machine.Apologies in advance for the poor quality images and messy workshop but when I was making this machine I had no intention of selling it so I didn't bother with fancy photos. I was also 18.I should also note I built this entire thing by hand and with a £100 drill press. All the machined components (excluding spindle) were made by a crappier version of this machine.Do Not try this at home... it was not fun. All the next machines will be made on a large VMC. This thing is cool nglThe initial batch price is double the normal price and for that you get a more rigid machine with servos and it should arrive much sooner, especially if you live in the UK. It won't be the best value for money, so only choose this option if you really want to support us and be a part of something new. This will be done separately to kickstarter.Please contact us for more details.samurai.machine.tools@gmail.comThe hardest part of making a DIY CNC is the spindle. The market is currently full of large spindles from China, so if you need a small BT30 spindle for your machine look no further.Don't want to pay full price for a machine? Pledging for just 1 axis at a time might be the best option for you.The idea is that you buy the Y axis (base) for example and only pay £800. You can then assemble it and assess the quality and if you are happy you can order the rest of the machine. This is great for people who understandably don't want to risk all their money on kickstarter. Alternatively you could use it as a way to slowly upgrade your current DIY CNC. You could buy the spindle and attach it to your machine, then when you have saved up you could buy the Z axis (column) then base e.c.t.This is the first version of the machine we will be making because it is the cheapest and there's fewer things to go wrong. When you receive this machine you will have to assemble everything apart from the spindle. Then to get it working as a CNC machine you will need to add your own electronics. We will support you through this process.What's included:Standard CNC features:This is the full package. ATC, enclosure, flood coolant, touchscreen, lights, chip management, stand. Basically everything you would find in a typical VMC, just much smaller and much cheaper.We are currently not making this version of the machine, but it will be available Q3 2022. However if you pledge for a cnc or conversion kit you will later have the option to upgrade to the VMC.Standard VMC Features (coming later):ATC - £1500The ATC is something we are currently developing and it is in the early prototype stage. When complete it should be capable of tool to tool in 6 seconds and hold 14 tools.You will be able to attach it to any of our cnc machines.Servos - £4002x 100w JMC integrated servos1x 180w JMC integrated servo with brakeFirst part kit - £500Includes everything needed to make a part, which is a tool tightening fixture.1x Precision Vice1x BT30 tool holder5x Vertex ER Collets5x High quality end mills appropriate for the job5x Aluminium billets1x Small air compressorSupport through the process and instruction videos.We think customers should have the right to repair any product they own. Also with a CNC machine it is much easier to find faults and fix them with new parts unlike a smartphone or any other device.This machine has been designed to make assembly and disassembly relatively easy, but more importantly, the most expensive component on this machine costs just £200. That means if there is ever an issue with anything, its likely that you will only be set back £200 at most, and thats something completely new to the industry.Also the total cost of all the bearings is £200, that means in a few years when the machine is near the end of its life you can replace all bearing components for £200 and the machine will be as good as new.Unlike most companies, we charge less money for replacement parts than they cost us. That way if you need to buy a replacement part, we lose money, and therefore there is no conflict of interest. Many other companies charge way too much on replacement parts, essentially making money from that, therefore they have no interest to make a more reliable product since they make money when something goes wrong.We are past the prototyping stage, and the final CAD models are mostly completed, but there is still some work to do to ensure the models are perfect. The next thing to do is order the components from china, give the go ahead to our UK manufacturers, and make some of the aluminium parts ourselves. The only thing we haven't decided on yet is the material for the sheet metal. Its likely to be 5051 but we are considering SS304 or Aluminized steel for increased durability.A production prototype will be made and tested to ensure all the improvements from the prototype don't have any negative effects and if all is good the rest of the machines will be made.We all know Kickstarter is notorious for having failed projects and we don't want to follow that trend. With the initial batch, we can actually guarantee your machine will be made, and if not, you will get a full refund.For the Kickstarter machines to be made, we will need to make a total of 40 sales by September 2022. Previously it would have been difficult for us to guarantee that but we are very quickly growing our Instagram page and are finding new potential buyers every week. Also when the Initial batch machines are delivered that will convince a lot more people to buy.Kickstarter payments are done through bank transactions and there is not the option for PayPal. You will only be charged at the end of the campaign so please make sure your card has sufficient funds by that time (1st December).Payment for the initial batch will be done via PayPal invoice and there will be the option for financing. While we do offer worldwide shipping, there is currently a huge supply chain issue in the global economy and that will slow things down. As a result, we are not including the shipping price in the pledge amount so you will have to pay for that after the campaign. The price may range from £400-1000 and lead time is not guaranteed right now. If you need a machine urgently you may be able to pay extra for faster delivery.What we can guarantee however is that the machines will be made in just a few months so if the situation does improve you may receive a machine much sooner than you expect.You will get one year warranty on your Samurai for parts that unexpectedly fail. However it is expected that ballscrews and other bearings will wear down according to how you use the machine.All parts to the machine will be available on our website and installation instructions will also be available.",

                "Text": "Chronicle is a quick, simple approach to logging and rating your favorite strains of cannabis. Keep track of what you like, weed out what you don’t.What we are building:A digital journal that keeps track of your chronic, Chronicle simplifies the cannabis rating and logging process. It’s easy to access your favorite products and strains, so you are prepared for your next dispensary visit.As the cannabis industry evolves, there has been an increased understanding of cannabinoids and their effects. Simply put, cannabis affects everyone differently. The typical sativa, indica and hybrid indicators generally aren't enough to help you figure out if you’ll enjoy a particular strain. Two common responses from people who have tried cannabis are that they’ve felt sleepy or paranoid. Keeping track of strains they’d rather avoid would make many people’s cannabis journeys much smoother.Some Features Include:More Features To Come:Why we are building Chronicle:Twenty years ago, cannabis was illegal in all 50 states. Two decades later, we are inching our way closer to federal legalization, with more than a third of U.S. states legalizing both medicinal and recreational adult use. What does that mean? An influx of cannabis information, products, strains and terminology have made their way into everyday conversation and consumption.When I moved to Colorado, I experienced this firsthand; I was completely overwhelmed by the amount of products available. I thought, how can one keep track of every product they consume? How can you remember to not purchase a strain that once made you feel paranoid? I wanted a quick and easy tool to keep track of what I like, and with the incorporation of a rating system, weed out what I don’t.My partner Travis's late father attempted to learn more about medical marijuana but found it uncomfortable to walk into a modern dispensary with no cannabis knowledge. He was overwhelmed by all of the products. The information given to him by budtenders did not match his personal experience with cannabis strains and products, and he began journaling his cannabis journey to discover his preferences himself.Together, Travis and I felt Chronicle was a product that could benefit all types of cannabis consumers — even the experienced cannabis user. We've been running the cannabis design agency Resin Refinery together for three years, with the goal of reducing the stigma surrounding cannabis brands. We have helped dispensaries and brands appeal to the modern cannabis consumer and now feel that we can make a larger impact directly helping cannabis consumers. Our design and development skills allowed us to create Chronicle with no starting capital.At this point, 75% of the base functionality is in the Chronicle app, with just minor backend work remaining. We have our app flow finished and now just need to clean up the design and experience.Our budget will primarily be used for marketing purposes. Because cannabis isn't federally legal, social media platforms have yet to update their content policies to reflect legalization in large portions of the country — making it difficult for cannabis-related companies to effectively market their products. Therefore our efforts will be accomplished by partnering with the right influencers and promoting posts.Early Bird Supporter:Early Bird Super Fan:Tier 1 Rewards:Tier 2 Rewards:Tier 3 Rewards:Tier 4 Rewards:Tier 5 Rewards:Tier 6 Rewards:",

                "Text": "When it comes to outdoor activities, we all know how much we appreciate gears that are efficient, lightweight and versatile to save us from hassle.Whether you want to take a short break during the hike, stay put to capture the perfect shot or wait patiently while fishing, it is when quick and comfortable seating comes in handy. Ta-Da Chair Series 2 is the ideal essential for those who seek portability and functionality. When stashed, It serves as a hiking stick with a comfortable grip; and to make it a chair, it takes only a second to set up. Let us show you how fast and easy it is to set it up!Ta-Da Chair Series 2 is perfect for all kinds of outdoor activities: camping, hiking, beach trips, picnics, festivals and concerts - you name it!It folds slim into a hiking stick that boasts extra mobility and won’t occupy any precious space in your backpack when you’re out there venturing. Grab a chair and enjoy the moment. Wherever, whenever!A simple design is not equal to compromising on the details. In order to be comfortable from sitting down to getting up, the seating height is 50cm off the ground, while most camping chairs and stools sit low, so no need to overly bend your knees and scrunch your legs to get up!When sitting down, your legs are in a natural position with sufficient space to keep yourself comfortable.Most foldable camping chairs come with fabric seats that allow you to sink into it, it is difficult to get out of and could be uncomfortable for your legs and knees, or it gets saggy after some time of use. When you sit down, The solid texture seat provides a firm seating; and it is also a breeze to get up when you need to act fast on the move.With its special design, setting up is easier than ever, just like opening and closing an umbrella. Simply release the seat lock, push the switch grip down and secure it. It takes only a second, and you’ve got yourself a comfy seat!To take down and stow it, pull the seat up and lock it back into a slim stick.Ta-Da Chair Series 2 is a compact yet heavy duty chair. The aviation-grade aluminum alloy structure allows the chair to hold its position and prevents it from collapsing easily. Combining the reinforced stainless steel rim and the safety buckle, it weighs only 1 kg (2 lbs) yet supports weight up to 130kg (286 lbs). The anti-slip and anti-sink rubber feet with a spiral pattern that provides more stability, allowing the chair to be placed anywhere from pebble path to smooth surface.The seat and the plastic components are UV resistant, and the frame is made of top quality aviation-grade aluminum alloy, making it not only strong, but also corrosion resistant, waterproof and easy to clean. No matter the weather condition or the terrain, this is the perfect essential for all your outdoor activities!Aiming to provide great portability and extra mobility, it is light in weight and comes with an ergonomic handle that is made easy for taking it on the go and serves as a hiking stick, taking no space in your backpack or luggage.With every Ta-Da Chair Series 2, we offer a free storage bag. The bag is made of nylon and it is laundry machine washable and strong. You can toss it in the back of the trunk or carry it another way using the strap to bring it over the shoulders. There are lots of foldable chairs on the market, but we noticed that many of them or the camping gears require taking more time and several steps to put together. If less time is spent on set up, the more time is saved for enjoying.Another seemingly inevitable issue with most foldable chairs is that no matter what kind of chair you bring along to the outdoors, even the lightest ones take up space in your backpack, it's still the burden for space-conscious people, so we wondered if we could give the chair another purpose when it’s folded. Therefore, we came up with the idea of combining these functions and Ta-Da Chair was born.We made operating the chair super fast and easy, just like opening and closing an umbrella - absolutely effortless, perfect for users of all ages. However, it’s not easy to make a simple and one-piece design that is as steady and durable. From the structure to the material, we spared no detail and worked hard to overcome the challenges. After months of tests and adjustments, we managed to create the folding chair that met our standards, and we sincerely hope you will find it amazing, too!We call this project Ta-Da Chair \"Series 2\" as this is the upgraded version of our previous design. In hope of bringing convenience and comfort, but without sacrificing on the experience, we have created the 1st generation of Ta-Da Chair earlier. We valued the feedback from every user and we knew that this product had the potential to be even better.Here are some major upgrades and improvements that we made for Ta-Da Chair Series 2:The structure of Series 2 is simpler but it provides more sturdiness and durability than the 1st generation. After the hard work on research and tests, we designed a reinforced stainless steel rim to hold the structure better and provide more stability. With this new design, the weight capacity has been increased: Series 2 can support up to 130kg, which is 30kg more than the 1st generation (around 100kg capacity load).The area of the seat surface of Series 2 is larger and wider by 15% than the 1st generation for extra comfort.In the 1st generation, the lock has to be twisted to unlock and expand the chair. For Series 2, we made a refinement of the lock and changed the way from twisting to clipping, and the new switch grip is made for easy operation: push it to unfold, and pull it to pack up - saving you force and time, with much smoother movement. The handle of Series 2 is shaped into a closed loop for a comfortable grip, and you can also hang it for easy storage.After one year of numerous brainstorming, refinements and tests, we’re proud to present Ta-Da Chair Series 2 with the enhanced features that allow you to venture out with ease and flexibility, and we’re sure that you’ll be satisfied with it!Here in Step2Gold, we have accumulated years of solid experience and techniques, all products are made with precision down to every detail; and with our own factory in our homeland, every process during the manufacturing is carefully planned and monitored to hold the best control of production and quality. It is our goal to develop innovative and top quality products to improve outdoor experience and make everyday life more convenient and joyful.We’re proud to be recognized by several international design awards: Good Design, International Design Excellence Awards, Concours Lépine International Paris, Geneva International Inventions etc.  ",

The guideline is to wash for 20 seconds.Well, humans are very bad at estimating time and what they think is 20 seconds, is really about 5 seconds!In addition, while they scrub their hands with soap, the water is usually running, which is very wasteful. Now, I'm a person who cares deeply about saving water and even have a product that helps reduce water waste! You can check it out at  https://SensiTap.com and watch the brief video on the home page.Lastly, I watch children do a half-hearted job of scrubbing, given their short attention spans.I decided that I would make a product that would help solve all three problems:We plan to make the device transparent, so folks can see how HandyDandy works! They will be able to see the valve moving back and forth, lights go on and off. They will see a turbine spin when the water goes past the vanes.The result of all this, is HandyDandy!We have a very advanced prototype running (you can see it in the demo video).What we need to do now is to make it into a marketable product.We need your help to do that.The money you pledge will go towards:Our proven track record of products should give you, the Kick Starter Patron, a sense of confidence that we have an above-average chance of succeeding.I am a dyed-in-the-wool engineer, with over 40 years of experience, almost 30 of those as a consultant.

You can experience the virtual cycling world as if you were riding there yourself.Participants from all over the world can train and compete in the virtual world. Participants from around the world train, compete and ride in friendly competitions with their friends.

You can also measure your own FTP.FIT CYCLE is compatible with a variety of virtual apps, allowing you to play apps right away without the need for complicated settings. Virtual apps can be broadly divided into two types: those that ride on real, live-action scenery and those that ride on 3DCG scenery.The appeal of virtual cycling lies in its realism. The system automatically changes the load by interfacing sensors with the app, and the load reflects the slope of the hill, air resistance, and other details of the surrounding environment, making it very close to the actual ride.You can ride on real roads around the world in the comfort of your own home with your smart bike, and the high-resolution 4K live-action scenery will make you feel as if you are really there.KinomapKinomap is an app that allows you to ride real courses taken by cyclists around the world.

Zwift was also used by Corona to stage the Tour de France. Not only can you train with professional riders, but you can also customize your avatar, road bike, and more.I want to try it! But... the hurdle to play is too high.Currently, there are two major combinations of equipment needed to play with Zwift.In this case, the cost of the smart trainer alone is $900 to $1,800USD, and you also need to prepare a road bike to attach to the trainer.In the second case, the cost is lower than in the first, but you need more equipment and more time to set up. In addition, both of them require a road bike as a prerequisite, making it difficult to get started. All you need is your smartphone and FIT CYCLEIn the midst of all this, a spin bike-type trainer called \"Smart Bike\" has appeared overseas this year. Smart bikes, which can be optimized to your own position without the need to set up a bike, have been attracting attention, but they are very expensive, costing around $4,500USD, and are only for professional use.Because of this, we have set an affordable price so that everyone can enjoy Virtual Cycling at their homes. We have developed Japan's first integrated fitness machine with various built-in sensors.Furthermore, it is possible to experience virtual cycling indoors at a low cost!Virtual training for everyone! As people spend more and more time at home, why don't you enjoy exercising with FIT CYCLE?This is a record of the weight loss of a customer at a gym that installed this product.

Kinomap, lets you ride through videos taken and posted by other cyclists, and TrainerRoad, which specializes in upping your game. Choose the app that best fits your goals and motivation, and enjoy cutting-edge training!ROUVY offers a real-world riding experienceMulti-functional sensors are compatible with virtual training apps.FIT CYCLE is equipped with the following advanced sensors and CPU. This allows you to take full advantage of the app's features for an enhanced virtual ride.Automatic load function (power meter) that realistically reproduces gradients on hills and other slopesAutomatically adjusts the load on the virtual ride to match the course. The trainer automatically adjusts the load according to the course on the virtual ride. When the course on the app goes up a hill, the load on the trainer automatically changes to match the slope of the hill, giving you a realistic ride. The load is applied by changing the voltage on the electromagnetic magnet. This happens by moving the electromagnet closer or further away from the flywheel. Since it is a non-contact system, the unit is very quiet.It can apply a stronger load than ordinary magnet load systems and allows a wide range of load adjustments.Equipped with a sensor that measures the cadence (number of revolutions of the crank per minute) of the bicycle.When you ride, be aware of keeping the cadence constant and choose a gear that does not strain your legs, which will reduce the burden and make your cycling more comfortable.Finding the right cadence for you is an important point when riding, and depends on the individual's physical strength and build, the type of bicycle, length of the crank, situation, and more.Manage your exercise record with smartwatch and healthcare integrationAlthough the heart rate sensor on the handlebars can be used, using a smartwatch will allow you more freedom, accuracy, and integration with your health care system (*specifications may vary depending on the app). Keep track of your exercise records along with a variety of other biometric data to keep track of your overall health status in life.We designed FIT CYCLE to become a fitness partner in your daily life.  \"no noise\" is a point that cannot be overlooked.The FIT CYCLE is so quiet that it can be compared to a whisper or a late night in the suburbs. This means you don't have to worry about disturbing your neighbors.As explained in the beginning, you will need a device such as a smartphone to run the virtual training app.Depending on the situation, you can choose the best way to use the device according to the size of the room and the device you have, such as using a computer, projecting on a TV screen, or using a projector. Can be used as a standalone machine.Even if you don't use the virtual cycling app, you can use the FIT CYCLE app to set the load that suits you best and checks your calorie consumption.You can also update the machine’s software through the app.The FIT CYCLE app will be available for download from the App Store and Google Play Store.Please note that the design is in the development stage and is subject to change.The saddle can be adjusted from 81cm to 98cm, and the handlebars from 97cm to 108cm. (The saddle can also be moved forward and backward by 0-5.5 cm)The height range is 145-190cm, so it can be adjusted to fit various body sizes for comfortable use.The legs in front of the main unit are equipped with wheels for easy movement. This makes it easy for a single person to move it around, such as when redecorating or rearranging the room.There is no need for complicated setups required in conventional virtual training. The minimal number of parts eliminates the need for complicated assembly.Please note that the design is still in the development stage and is subject to change.SpecificationsPedals For Barefoot UseThe included pedals have an uneven tread for better grip and are designed to be used with shoes. Therefore, you cannot pedal barefoot or with socks. To use it barefoot, you will need the optional barefoot pedals.Anti-vibration and soundproof mat to reduce vibrationAs mentioned above, the main unit alone is quite enough, but for those who are concerned about the burden on the floor or want to reduce vibration, even more, we have prepared a custom-designed anti-vibration soundproofing mat as an option!Be considerate of your surroundings and the environment, and enjoy your virtual ride to the fullest!Virtual Shift to maximize your training effect.You can incorporate shifting gears from major manufacturers such as Shimano, SRAM, and Campagnolo with virtual shifting.

                "Title": "Animation controler for O and I scale train models",
                "Text": "Ultimate Models was launched in April 2021, when Laurent ROEKENS & Sébastien GRENIER met each others and discovered they had the same passion : model trains.We design animation systems allowing you to add motion, sound or light  in any model. Our first product, named Perfect Coach Lighting, is an animation controler for HO/OO scale passenger  coaches. It provides realistic animations & effects in each part of the coach, bringing the appropriate light in each compartment, corridor,  rest room, and so on...you can then fully control the lights trough the DCC command system.Provided animations include : night fall, conductor passing through the coaches to check tickets, passengers going to the rest room at some moments, van switching on during a station stop and turning off when the train left the station, and many more other features.A short while after we started to sale these animation controlers, we've been called by some customers willing to have the same product for greater O and I scales.It took some time to design a specific product that would meet all requirements for such a product : more power was required for each light as the coaches are at least 8x bigger. Customers also wanted to be able to use our devices on live steam trains, which have neither any DCC command system nor any corresponding power source.Finally, we've made a prototype and validated all electronical aspects.Now we have to find funds to both build the required software and produce the first parts.Follwing videos demonstrate some of the animations of the HO scale animation controlers... This new product is designed in a different way than the HO scale one. Small models are really hard to patch by customers : not so much space, small pieces easy to break....that's why we deliver ready to use HO scale ramps.This is not the same with O and I scale models : customers often patch their products to perfectly meet their will.That's why we decided to build a universal controler that will fit in any coach, instead of a wide range of dedicated products. The result is a small circuit of no more than 54 x 29 mm providing ready to solder power outputs but with no embedded LEDs.Each output can drive several LEDs for up to 20 mA. All outputs are protected against overload by an internal current limitation. LEDs voltage can be of up to 3.2 Volts, the power source providing 3.3 Volts.Both + and - of each LED wires can be soldered on the back side of the decoder.The 2 pad power input labeled DCC can receive any power source, either AC or DC, between 6 and 24 volts. When a DCC command signal is present, it is decoded and used to drive the circuit.Usual power sources includes regular \"through the track\" DCC power and usual batteries placed under the coach. No matter which power source you use, the circuit can be driven with the free mobile App from any Apple or Android compatible device. The app allows you to setup every channel settings such as the emulated light type and associated power. It also allows you to switch on and off every channel and every animation.Animations are managed at several levels : for a single coach only, for a full set of coaches (train), of for any known coach from your collection. This allows you, for instance, to switch all your coaches to the \"night mode\" in a single command.In fact, every existing function from our HO-scale ramp also exists in the XL universal decoder and can be managed from both the DCC commands and the mobile app !Power failure is a common issue when using DCC : crossing a switch or running along a dirty track often produce bad power continuity, leading to decoder unwanted resets.Power Packs are the solution for those issues, and most of the customers consider Power Packs as a \"must have\" for any DCC system.Our Perfect Coach Lighting XL decoder is power-pack ready. 3 connection pads can be used to connect our optional dedicated power-pack which will provide at least 5 seconds of power sustain under full load. But Power Packs are not required when using battery powered system together with Live Steam, that's why they can be purchased as an option.",

                "Text": "Because human behavior is so unpredictable, clever, creative and incredibly brilliant, understanding outliers of behavior can be challenging. When humans behave irrationally, with anger, through deception, or other jarring actions that many times may cause harm the origin/intention of the behavior sparks curiosity. Inspired by the intention of various forms of human behavior, I wanted to create a platform that embraces the process of understanding behavior without bias, judgement or stereotypes. I wanted to see if there was a way to disrupt the classroom to prison pipeline, clean up policing in underserved communities, change behavior modification of youth in schools, and help organizations improve performance in the workplace.As a graduate of UCLA and a former NBA athlete, my collective experiences, skill sets, and visions to create behavioral solutions have evolved and allowed me to create cutting-edge solutions that shape the body, mind and behavior of student-athletes. My new software Assessdo, created by Barin Technologies, not only offers the opportunity to support student athletes, but ideally become an interface for entities such as: educational institutions, law enforcement agencies, justice systems, healthcare providers, human resources and youth programs. Assessdo uses proprietary AI technology to predict, interpret, observe and ideally transform behavior. It can be a gateway to facilitate honest discussions with groups of any size and create a turnkey breakthrough of powerful dialogue.According to our research, there are two major challenges that interrupt behavior: 1) confirmation bias and 2) stereotype threats. Understanding why implicit bias exists and how to tackle the problem was one inspiration for creating this software. Other inspirations for creating Assessdo was: 1) noticing the influx of young people becoming incarcerated at an early age, 2) learning about the correlation of prison reform with mental health, 3) how police training is affecting rates of incarceration, wrongful deaths, and the unnecessary mistreatment of civilians, and 4) how the relationships between teachers, faculty, students, communities, and districts negatively affect school systems. We invite you to learn about our platform, as we believe there is power in understanding the whole of every person, not just parts. Our users will experience fair equity while having the ability to think and feel freely. Contact Rodney Zimmerman - rodneyzimmerman14@gmail.com ",

                "Title": "Go with the Flow: a Portable Laminar Flow Hood",
                "Text": "The Fungaia Laminar Flow Hood opens new horizons in biology, making the benefits of sterile culture technique more accessible than ever before. At a fraction of the size and cost of comparable units, this compact, efficient, affordable design serves two important roles:First, a simple desktop model makes an economical entry-level flow hood for students, hobbyists and other aspiring biologists, helping overcome the biggest stumbling block of newcomers to the field: contamination. Second, a rugged, handheld, fully battery-powered model allows biologists to carry the lab into the field instead of the other way around, enabling research techniques that were never possible before.Both of these functions promise a revolution in our relationship with our living world. We dream of a new generation of self-appointed scientists, globally connected and locally focused, equipped with the tools and knowledge to make new strides toward understanding, preserving and rejuvenating the Earth’s precious, vulnerable ecologies.A laminar flow hood is an air filtration device, widely used throughout the biological sciences, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, nuclear technology and manufacturing. Flow hoods create a sterile working environment for sensitive tasks, such as the isolation and propagation of fungi, plants, bacteria and other microorganisms.The microbial realm is wildly complex. Living things pervade every breath of air we breathe. When creating an ideal environment for a given organism to grow, there are many others that thrive in the same conditions, and not all of them are friendly. This is why biologists rely on sterile culture technique.For example, when gathering biological samples from the wild for analysis, preservation or breeding purposes, the interval between collection and isolation is critical. Such samples are often highly perishable and susceptible to rapid parasitization and decomposition, which leads to insurmountable experimental error. A portable flow hood greatly improves the extent and success of field work.To use another example relevant to us here at Fungaia, sterile culture technique is an important part of mushroom cultivation. Like most organisms, a mushroom-producing fungus is delicate and vulnerable during the early stages of its growth, easily overtaken by more rapid reproducers. Until it has a chance to “grow up,” the trick is less about cultivating what is wanted and more about avoiding what isn’t.Another one of the beautiful things about sterile technique is that it allows a small laboratory to maintain a vast biodiversity of different organisms which would not be able to coexist otherwise.But for most of us in the industry, the real benefit of a laminar flow hood is that it reduces the chances of failure, from heartbreakingly likely to reliably rare. As anyone who has dabbled in mushroom cultivation will tell you, nothing can sap a passionate enthusiasm faster than disappointment.Until now, access to this technology has been limited to institutions, professionals and a few intrepid do-it-yourself-ers. By making it available to everyone, we hope to engender a growing movement of citizen scientists. A handful of specialists from a handful of universities can only accomplish so much. But with a flow hood in every home, there is no limit to the possibilities our collective curiosity might uncover. Who knows? Together we might even save the world.The Fungaia Flow Hood is a powerful tool with a simple design. It measures just 12 inches square by 10 inches deep, large enough to perform almost any sensitive laboratory task while still small enough to comfortably carry in one hand or place in the corner of a desk.The standard housing is water-resistant plywood, box-jointed for strength, with an attractive hardwood veneer available in a variety of stains and finishes. It can be upgraded to rugged aluminum body for durability.The “GrowHood” is our desktop model, optimized for a minimal footprint and cost, with a simple acrylic tunnel to offer greater protection from cross-drafts and the Venturi effect.The “GoHood” is our portable fieldwork unit, featuring airtight stainless steel closures on both openings to protect the filters and maintain sterility during transport. The forward face folds down to double as a stable work surface, and it sports a collapsable silicone tunnel.A removable aluminum rear cover provides access to the MERV-13 pre-filter and pulse-width signal generator for selecting the desired air velocity. A slim, watertight on/off switch and DC power port keep the narrow profile.Each model can be run on wall power (the most economical option) or configured with one, two or four battery packs, balancing weight, cost and capacity for up to 4, 8 or 16 hours of continuous runtime at full power on a single charge.Meet the Molicel: the beating heart of the GoHood. Truly the state-of-the-art in lithium ion cells, these batteries boast unparalleled energy density, rapid charging, and a great lifespan. Assembled into packs in-house, each cell is of trusted origin, thoroughly tested and independently protected. Up to four packs can be connected in parallel and fit neatly inside the unit without obstructing airflow.The blower fan, which was designed for high-pressure cryptocurrency mining servers, is equipped with an internal pulse-width modulator that allows complete velocity control with no detriment to its lifespan. It is quiet, powerful and remarkably efficient, drawing just 0.9 amps at full power while delivering an impressive 170 cfm.The most important piece of all, the filter pack uses a top-of-the-line HEPA Mini-pleat® filter, delivering the same performance as standard filter media at half the size and lower static resistance, also improving overall efficiency. Custom manufactured by the industry leader, these packs are scanned and tested to a minimum 99.997% filtration efficiency at 0.3µ. We test them again following assembly to verify their efficacy.By using only the highest quality components, assembling and testing each flow hood carefully by hand in-house, and providing complete parts and service, customer support and educational resources, we seek to exemplify integrity, ingenuity and dedication to our craft, all while making every effort to keep this technology as accessible as possible to everyone.Read on to learn more about how we intend to put our business ethics into practice.On November 15th, we are launching a Kickstarter campaign to raise the funding to begin full-scale production.If (when!) we get funded, it will allow us to make a sizable bulk order of the fans, filters, batteries and other components to build and maintain an inventory. This will enable us to produce custom-order flow hoods on demand in the future.The fundraising campaign will run through the holiday season, and we will begin fulfillment as soon as the project gets funded. Due to ongoing supply chain disruptions and unusually long manufacturing lead times, we have set a conservative target fulfillment date of June 2022, though we hope to deliver much sooner. Orders will be shipped first-come, first-served, based on the initial funding pledge date.The central goal of this project is to make laminar flow hood technology accessible to everyone. Here are some of the ways we intend to honor that commitment:First, this project is born from a DIY ethic. Staying true to that ideal, we will create a series of detailed plans and instructions, along with straight-forward how-to videos, to share with anyone who wishes to embark on a flow hood project of their own. Like all of Fungaia’s other products, these will be available by donation, with no minimum.Second, we will also stock all of the necessary components at competitive prices, serving as a one-stop-shop for our fellow DIY-ers, and offer fully customized kits alongside our finished products, so each person can forego as much or as little of the actual assembly as they wish, depending on their skills, resources and budget.Third, we are committed to ensuring the longevity and sustainability of our products. All of our flow hoods will be warrantied and fully serviceable. We will offer self-service tutorials as well as full technical support and maintenance services. We scoff at planned obsolescence and want to make sure you can keep your Fungaia Flow Hood running for as long as possible.Last, and most exciting of all, we are delighted to announce that we will offer a scholarship program. Homegrown with slender means, Fungaia is a manifestation of the spirit of the cash-poor but can-do, and we believe wholeheartedly that everyone deserves access to groundbreaking technology, regardless of personal means. Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis, evaluated for both need and merit, and we will give away as many flow hoods to deserving candidates as we can afford to!By keeping production in-house, we can create new jobs and continue to ensure the integrity of our products. Depending on the success of the Kickstarter campaign, the flow hood project, and the business in general, we hope to soon hire additional employees and restructure Fungaia as an employee-owned cooperative.Ultimately, all of this is in service of yet a greater goal: education. A heart-centered, donation-based business, Fungaia was founded with the hope that it would eventually become the economic engine to support a Free School: an experimental, experiential, residential, educational, intentional community of like-minded teacher-students of all walks of life.By supporting and sharing this project, you are instrumental in fostering a vision of prosperity—both our own and that of the living planet we call home.Homegrown in Walla Walla, Washington, Fungaia is a heart-centered, donation-based mushroom company, driven by deep passion and a vision for sustainable symbiosis. Firmly rooted in a do-it-yourself ethos, we endeavor to demystify fungi and make mushroom cultivation accessible to newcomers and lifelong mycophiles alike. We believe that fungi are the finest teachers, and can help guide us on a path toward greater personal and environmental health, food security, education, social responsibility, and joy.Read more at https://www.fungaia.life/ethos.Hi, my name is Paul. I’m the Lead Critter here at Fungaia, and delighted to share a little backstory with you.When this project began, my goal was to create a small laminar flow hood I could mount in my homemade truckbed camper and run off a small solar system, allowing me keep up with lab work and clone wild mushrooms while I was on the road. I had little money to seriously entertain such frivolous fantasies, so it went to the back burner like so many other fiendish schemes.With a few successful attempts at cloning wild mushrooms—and quite a few unsuccessful ones—it quickly became clear to me that the chances of salvaging a foraged specimen precipitously decline the longer it takes to get it to the lab. Some species, like the formidable Lawyer’s Wig (Coprinus comatus) seem to deliberately defy such attempts, mischievously deliquescing into black ooze and leaking out of the bag in the car.As time went on, I was wholly engulfed in the many challenges of running a small mushroom company. I was waiting tables in the evenings and devoting every spare moment and dollar to my fledgling Fungaia. The portable flow hood fantasy gained greater appeal. I could envision weeks-long excursions in exotic locales, punctuated by periodic tailgate lab work, and a whole new horizon for my aspirations to vagabondery. I dreamed of becoming a traveling mycologist.I began testing my theories and experimenting with some basic designs. Eventually, inevitably, my research led me down the rabbit hole of the do-it-yourself lithium ion battery pack. With the unparalleled energy density of these remarkable new batteries, could I build a flow hood small and light enough to carry by hand? My mind was aflame with the possibilities.Despite my better judgment, I had committed to the idea. When I really should have been buying fresh undies or perhaps saving up to move out of the backyard and into an apartment like a normal adult, instead I was buying top-of-the-line HEPA filters and lithium cells and pouring over spec sheets of low voltage, high-pressure fans.There is a phenomenon I call the “cascade of risk,” which is perhaps not unlike what mothers of fear of “gateway drugs,” and no doubt related to the fallacy of sunken value: when you get comfortable taking one risk, the next seems less threatening, and the next, until you’re gambling your last dollar on some hair-brained scheme and sloppily soldering dangerous components in your threadbare underwear in someone else’s garage at 3 o’clock in the morning.Nonetheless, I cobbled together my first prototype using some scrap wood and angle iron and, to my surprise, it worked flawlessly. I should have been delighted, but instead I began to feel nervous. It was no longer a plaything of my whimsy, it was a real-life thing in the world. I felt I had an obligation to it, like a parent, to protect and foster it to maturity.There is solace in destitution; to quote the Bard, “when y’ain’t got nothin’, you got nothin’ to lose.” Success, on the other hand, carries with it the burden of failure. The more I realized I may have stumbled across something of consequence, the more the possible consequences became apparent.My vivid imagination began conjuring all of the ways this contraption could get me in trouble. I’ll reach a bare hand into fire without hesitation, but when it comes to litigation I’ll flee faster than a housefly. To make matters worse, everyone I solicited for advice said the same thing: talk to a lawyer.I called around and found the most reputable IP law firm in the region and scheduled a consultation with one of the partners. I wanted to be as prepared as possible, so I wrote an extensively researched, detailed patent specification, complete with my own technical drawings, draft claims and a witnessed, notarized invention disclosure and sent it to the attorney for review.I think I he really didn’t know what to do with me. In the end, I paid a lot more than I could afford for some pretty second-rate advice, but at least I got a second pair of eyes and a professional patent search out of the deal: no one has made anything quite like it… at least not yet.Meanwhile, I was pouring over the new prototype. I wanted it to be sexy, not just functional. I envisioned the eMac of microbiology. Like any good first iteration, it was fabulously overwrought, with a steel frame that could withstand a tornado, a sleek, gasketed aluminum and stainless steel housing and enough lithium batteries and fans to blow Odysseus all the way back to Ithaca.It’s a worthy prototype, especially considering I made it using stock components and a 50-year-old spotty MIG welder. It has worked wonderfully and served me well on a number of field expeditions, but it’s bulky, it weighs a ton, it’s comically overpowered and the assembly was needlessly complex and more than a little frustrating.In the months since, I filed the patent application, solicited custom orders to my specifications from the manufacturers of the primary components, and began building a facility where I can assemble, test and ship the flow hoods. The latter has been the most involved task of all, especially as I’ve financed construction myself by the slender means of my small, donation-based business.Up until a few weeks ago, I have exclusively run my business out of a 350-square-foot former coal chute adjacent to the boiler room of a WWII-era Army hangar. I knew I would need more space, but I never want to be caught holding a lease I can’t afford. So I took the next logical step and tracked down a good deal on a second-hand insulated semi trailer and retrofitted it with doors, windows, and all the trimmings of civility. I installed new electrical service, an off-grid water system and a shop that will be sufficient for full-scale production.I’ve been working with the machine shop down the street, who’ve been good to me throughout the years, to fabricate the pieces that will be impractical for me to make in-house. Using the new, custom fan and filter components, I’ve begun assembling four new production-level prototypes to demonstrate the different configurations I’ll be offering on Kickstarter.These prototypes are smaller, lighter, quieter and more efficient than I ever thought possible. The first one, the desktop model featured in the product launch announcement video, is the simplest and most affordable. The next models will feature latching covers with gaskets and an optional aluminum housing for better protection from inclement field conditions.Optionally, each model can be configured with one or more battery packs for up to 4, 8 or 16 hours of continuous runtime on a single charge. The fan, which was designed for high-pressure cryptocurrency mining servers, is equipped with an internal pulse-width modulator that allows complete velocity control with no detriment to its lifespan. The filter pack uses a state-of-the-art HEPA Mini-pleat® filter which offers the same performance as the first prototype at half the size.I have been working with the new prototype for several weeks and have been thrilled with the results. While I’ve grown accustomed to the much larger flow hood I built for my business, to my surprise this small device has been quite comfortable to use for every process I can imagine needing it for. I can’t wait for you to try it.",

My mom said her kitchen cabinet was broken and couldn’t find a good carpenter…That night it looked like destiny was beckoning us to think outside the box; because all of sudden the broken kitchen cabinet also had a broken leaking pipe. Our dining room was flooding…We tried to reach a plumber we knew but we could not get hold of him. So we called an aunt, who called a friend, and the friend called a cousin, who called a neighbor…When they finally got the plumber, they asked him, can you fix this issue tonight...his response in pidgin was, \"I Fit DO\" That was the eureka moment.So we decided to create an app called IFITDO (pidgin English) which means \"I can do it\". :We are solving a problem which was previously unsolvable. For many foreigners who visit Ghana, and also Ghanaians living abroad, and at those at home it is a problem finding certain services easily, quickly, and efficiently. 1. Difficulty in quickly finding a service provider when you need one:Ghanaians at home and abroad, and foreigners need some service when visiting the country.  However, it is not easy to quickly find someone to provide a service.  2. Quickly finding someone within a 3-mile radius:Most people find it difficult to get someone quickly when they need service in an immediate area in a 3mile radius 3. Service Providers not targeted to Service Seekers:Service providers in most cases find service seekers by chance or through word of mouth referral which often limits provider's chances of getting a job. or providing a service.1. Quickly and efficiently help people find services :A quick and efficient way to get services is by connecting service seekers with service providers. 2. providing opportunity where there is none:An easy way for students, professionals, and the unemployed to make some cash is by readily connecting them with service seekers. 3. Community aspect:The community focus on where locals are doing work for locals.Our app is bi-dimensional. Meaning we are developing it in such a way that you can be both a service seeker and service provider and experience the same exceptional experience. There is so much more to do in order to successfully bring the app to users on both ios and android, and we need your help to make this happen.

                "Text": "'DearBuds' is an ear-care device that intelligently manages the humidity levels in your ears.It monitors the temperature and humidity information inside the ear in real-time. Based on this information, DearBuds will adjust the humidity levels in your ears to the optimal levels so that your ears stay fresh all day and night long!It’s easy to find the distinction between normal humidity and high humidity levels in the ear simply by looking at a picture. When the ear canals stay at high humidity levels for an extended period of time, it becomes an ideal environment for bacteria to grow. Over time, you can end up experiencing itchiness, stuffiness, or even pain in your ears.People tend to use cotton swabs or their fingers to excess humidity from their ears. Some people even bang the sides of their heads to force the water out. If you've done this yourself then you probably noticed that these methods are not very effective and can just end up being painful with little to no benefits.DearBuds is the best way for you to take preventative measures against itchiness, irritation, or even pain caused by excess amounts of humidity stuck in your ear.No need to spend your precious time pouring over an instruction manual. Simply place the DearBuds in your ears and press the button to activate. It doesn’t get any simpler than that!DearBuds’ technology may seem complex, but it’s actually really simple.DearBuds promotes ventilation through proper airflow.Up to 3 liters of air is circulated per minute to effectively discharge any excess humidity inside the ear. Since one session lasts for 3 minutes, up to 10 liters of air is circulated in and out of the ear canal through the airflow channels.Real-time multi-sensors map out the structure of the inner ear and measure the temperature as well as the humidity levels.Based on this information, the DearBuds will automatically use the appropriate levels of light, heat, and airflow to quickly expel humidity trapped inside the ear in just 3 short minutes! LED light is used to deliver heat all throughout the ear canal. The fans then send the warm air into your ears to dry out the sweat and moisture in your ears. The remaining humidity is then circulated out of the air so leave it feeling fresh.Our ears, like a vial, are in the shape of a long and narrow passage.As shown in the experiment conducted above, humidity does not disappear when a long, clogged glass tubing is left in a wet state.DearBuds's air path design quickly dries your ears to get them to the right humidity levels in 3 minutes tops.Whether you're a student, work-from-home employee, or just an avid lover of music and YouTube, earphones have become a necessity in our daily life now more than ever. However, nearly all earphone users are unaware of the potential negative impact that they could have on our bodies over time.When wearing most of the commercially available wireless earphones and headphones for more than 20 minutes, the humidity in the ear increases by an average of 30-40%. If this environment persists for a long time, the growth rate of bacterial and mold that can potentially invade your ear increases exponentially. We discovered that people who wear earphones from leading brands such as Apple and Samsung for an extended period of time take longer to reach homeostasis for both temperature and humidity levels in the ears.On the other hand, DearBuds users were able to reach normal temperature and humidity levels in just under 3 minutes. All functions can be operated at the touch of one button. You can easily check the humidity information at any point in the day.Modes can easily be switched using the button located inside the case.** Each mode has a different intensity of light, heat, and airflow. All modes operate for up to 3 minutes and automatically shut down when the comfort humidity level is reached.We used ultra-low noise magnetic levitation fans, optimized the design of the air vents, and applied a noise reduction filter to minimize the noise produced by the DearBuds.Even on the strongest mode, the fans in the DearBuds won't be louder than a normal conversation you'll have on an average day.**NoticeThe noise level of the DearBuds is relatively quiet, but it may seem loud to those who are extremely sensitive to sound since the device is placed close to the ear.Premium grade non-toxic silicone 365 days of comfortable use.DearBuds is made from the same premium grade non-toxic silicone that is used in medical devices that are meant to come into contact with human skin.DearBuds gently uses wind to dry your ears without irritating them. Instead of blowing air straight into the ear canal, DearBuds creates a microscopic airflow channel to safely remove and dispel trapped humidity from the ear. The wind speed is so gentle that it barely moves the flame on a candle.High humidity levels can be a problem, but so can low humidity levels for ear health. DearBuds hits the sweet spot and then automatically turns off when the proper humidity level is reached.We’ve tested multiple designs and ended up with a final design that can be worn by people with most ear shapes and sizes.  We also offer silicone eartips of different sizes so that you can customize your fit.The DearBuds are similar in size and weight to the earphones you probably wear. Each set of DearBuds also comes with a case designed for easy storage and portability.DearBuds Body (left/right), Charging Case,  Silicone Tips (small/medium/large), USB-C Charging Cable, Instruction Manual** Specifications for the prototype and may differ from the final product. ** Please note **DearBuds is not an audio device. It is a product that manages the humidity levels in the ear. Although the shape is similar to that of earbuds, they do not play any audio so please keep that in mind when selecting your rewards!Linkface is a company that develops biosignal sensors and wearable devices.

                "Text": "Why we are here:Hi there, Kickstarter community, hope you're all well and achieving the goals you set out when joining this online community of thinkers, creators and innovators.The reason why I am here is to change an idea and a beta app into a new solution for the ever-changing business world.A short story:A couple of months ago two colleagues and I began our journey working on a market innovation for the bricks and mortar retail market; we call this little innovation Fortuna.We plan to use Fortuna as a means to foster a greater sense of community between consumers and their local enterprises, both from their local and nearby markets. This will be done by providing an inexpensive service that reduces the barriers to engagement, giving the little guys a chance to thrive in an ever more competitive and centralised environment.The Idea:The concept is simple and best said in a paraphrase of Steve Jobs' announcement of the iPod. Whereas the iPod \"fit a thousand songs in your pocket\", we want to give local small brick and mortar stores the ability to \"promote their products in a thousand pockets in an inexpensive way.\" Sounds boastful, I know. :)All the above probably sounds great, but at the same time very much like a sales pitch. I guess your team is more interested in knowing where we currently stand and our understanding of the market.The Business:Fortuna is an application that is intended to provide an enhanced consumer purchasing power by locating, pricing and discovering local businesses while assisting them in increasing their sales without a substantial increase to their marketing budget.The Market:Fortuna's target market consists of two key consumer groups: 1) the paying clients, which would be enterprises classed as micro to medium, employing anywhere from 1-49 staff, of which there are currently 256,000; and 2) Ireland's digital citizens aged 18 and above, which amounts to 2.9 million people and growing. (This is our initial market; we have eye on global opportunities).Progress/Proof:Fortuna is currently progressing through the late stages of bug fixing and application tune-up with a market release capacity within 2-3 months.Fortuna is looking to expand the existing digital services for local enterprises nationwide, to facilitate a competitive market at a low cost. Examples of this could be your local takeaway or barber, spending hundreds of Euro a month on Google and Facebook marketing to get leads marketing to people which may or may not want their service, while with Fortuna it would be €10-20, with customers looking for their service based on the criteria stated above.Objectives/Future:Fortuna's objectives are simply to provide local businesses such as corner shops, independent grocers and sole traders the same opportunities to market and promote their goods and services to their local community in a cost-effective way, giving them a level footing with the big guys.Within 18 months of our launch, we plan to have a domestic consumer base of 450,000 app users with 4,000+ businesses on our platform, with further expansion globally with an end goal of 160 million users and 1,400,000+ businesses using the platform by the end of the 5th year of operation.Positive steps:- MVP undergoing debugging, with market release capacity within 2-3 months.- Due to external market conditions the market we are entering is growing.- Experienced team with 15 years of working in Software Development.- Our team has a combined experience of 5 years of working in direct sales, marketing, customer support and problem solving (not software related issues).- We have a vision that goes beyond just Fortuna, but a vision for a better, more competitive market, where the business currently left behind will actual get a chance to be the best they can be.",

                "Text": "https://www.autasticeducation.com/homeLook, I don't know you, and yet I can pretty much guarantee that you know someone with autism. That’s because roughly 1 in 60 people will be on the autism spectrum. It might be a family member, a friend, a classmate.  Almost universally, these people and their families have to fight tooth and nail to get basic access to resources like mental healthcare and education. Unfortunately, this is especially true for children with autism.  Children on the autism spectrum need a lot of therapy.  A lot!  On average they are recommended 36 hours of ABA therapy per week but at $120 per hour that would cost $225,000 per year.  No one can afford that, so these kids miss out. When they get that therapy at an early age, they make more friends, they are more likely to get a job, and they live longer. But it's a full-time job, and most insurance companies aren't going to cover those costs. Virtually all of the cognitive skills a behavioral therapist teaches can be taught through software. Memory,  language, and  attention, contrary to our collective intuition, are the easiest tasks to teach at an early age. I worked with kids on the spectrum from 3 -23 years old, and with them in mind, designed a curriculum that can teach kids regardless of severity and regardless of age. With Autastic Education, we can give children all the therapeutic lessons they need, for $20 a month. Don't get me wrong, in-person therapy is the best option, but for most kids on the spectrum, they just aren't getting what they need. Talk to the parents, they will tell you how stressed they are, how short on time they are, and how hard they have to work to get their kids fairly basic access to healthcare. Our team consists of Jack Seagle who has helped design and scaffold much of the core curriculum within Autastic Education, he put together our Kickstarter, and he is the co-founder of Autastic. Katie Clark is the Regional Behavior Analyst for Northeastern Utah Educational Services. With a decade of experience and several degrees and certificates behind her name, she oversees 9 school districts and 4 charter schools. In the clinic, she would be checking to make sure I am doing my job right, with our app, it's pretty much the same thing.  We go to her for data analytics and to make sure our algorithms are on point. The curriculum needs to be very precise in order to work with all kinds of different folks. With Katie and Jack, it couldn't be more precise. Finally,  me. I'm Kyle Krantz and I’m a Board Certified Behavioral Technician, I work directly with the kids in the clinic. After a few years of working with kids on the spectrum, I started working on this project to help close the gap that all my clients were experiencing.I know the numbers can be confusing but try to stick with me here. We are asking for $30,000, Kickstarter is an all or nothing platform, and if we dont get all of that than we get nothing and your money is given back. With $30,000 we can cover the remaining costs of our minimum viable product(MVP). Our MVP would be roughly $60,000, for 6 lessons and several minigames, this may not sound like much but this could be roughly 1000 hours of therapy (that would normally cost $120,000) But we need much more financial backing to build all the lessons we have planned. Each lesson averages roughly $8,000. We have the algorithms, and lesson designs worked out for 25 lessons taught through a process called discrete trial training.  All of these lessons will be provided at $20 a month.  With Kickstarter funding, we can help get this ball rolling. A good app needs to be fun, so we have lots of minigames designed and ready. A good app needs to be evidence-based, so running peer-reviewed research will be integral to our process (I'll be doing this initially but we will need to outsource later on). Our app is designed with low functioning autism in mind, but high functioning people with autism at a young age will benefit greatly.We prioritize the lessons we build based on their utility. The first ten lessons we will build focus on attention and memory. These lessons increase how well kiddos can learn in the future, and research metrics for these lessons are more accurate. We then begin to focus on verbal and emotional understanding. If we can get enough funding, after those 25 lessons we start working on more sophisticated approaches involving echoics, facial and voice recognition, virtual reality and much more. Much of this will require a fairly extensive amount of research and is planned for the mid to long-term. If you would like to learn more about some of the technical details, check out our website at  https://www.autasticeducation.com/home ",

                "Text": "The prototype of CNC Shaperoo 2025 was created as a successor to the Chinese CNC 3018 platform. The design was based on the assumption that the machine would have a similar workspace, but with significantly better rigidity, machining speed performance, and adjustable power of the AC-powered spindle. In short, the enormous power of a real milling machine was enclosed in a compact housing that fits on a workbench.BEGINNERS If you are new to milling, it is not a problem because the assembly of the machine is easy and you will be assisted by our instructional videos. They will guide you from folding, through setup, to running the machine and processing material.ADVANCEDShaperoo is also designed for users who require precision machining. This is ensured by a rigid frame, refined and dedicated electronics, and years of our experience in designing and building CNC machines. CNC machines, as well as 3D printers, provide many possibilities for creation. Compared to similarly priced machines, Shaperoo is extremely powerful and precise. For this reason, the CNC is the ideal machine for the do-it-yourselfer and the person who likes DIY. You can see examples of very simple DIY works in our videos.Engraving and cutting aluminium is also no problem for our machine.More advanced DIY and electronics enthusiasts may be interested in creating PCBs, for which our machine is also very well suited.CNC system board based on Arduino nano 328, compatible with GRBL 1.1 and Estlcam.\n\n   The board allows to control CNC machines using GRBL, Estlcam, or Chilipeppr firmware. Optically isolated inputs and outputs provide overvoltage protection on Arduino module ports while ensuring stable operation.In addition to the typical leads for the GRBL, the laser, air assist, and PWM 0-10V connectors were also brought out. All three axes operate with backlash-canceling trapezoidal screws, allowing precise milling of even such complex tasks as circuit boards. Yes, it is possible! Thanks to a dedicated speed controller designed and manufactured by us, it is possible to adjust the spindle speed in the range of 10 000 - 20 000 RPM directly from control software (GRBL Candle, Estlcam).Thanks to the measuring functions built into the software, it is possible to measure the surface and angular displacement of the workpiece.This functionality is particularly useful when milling PCBs, providing a constant cavity, eliminating surface irregularities.The Estlcam software allows you to control the machine from a PC. Using its full potential, we have added a remote control to the machine to facilitate precise guidance of the spindle to the start position.Years of experience in working with CNC machines allowed us to design a device that is easy to assembly, affordable but still very accurate. The base of the construction is made of L-type aluminum profiles, which provide rigidity to the whole machine. . Structural elements are made in 3D printing technology, with gyroid filling no less than 50%. As a result, we deliver high-quality and durability elements.Unlike most CNC's, the Shaperoo has a shielded work area so 95% of the chips stay inside, this allows for a safer and cleaner work area. In case of an emergency there is an emergency stop button on the front of the machine.It's been a while since we started working on our machine. Shaperoo 2025 is still a prototype, but the progress that has been made since the first version is enormous. The biggest achievements of this work are the development of our own controller boards, spindle PWM, tool length measurement and table mapping.

Growing up, our parents only spoke Spanish in this great land of opportunity; and as parents ourselves, we can only imagine the struggles they went through trying to give us the world, but being held back because they didn’t speak English. That’s why we came up with CoVoice, an app that connects people who need help understanding what someone is saying, with someone who can help translate. We like to say it’s the Uber of getting a translator.So, whether you’re a parent who wants to understand what your child's teacher is saying at their parent teacher conference, have car issues and need to communicate to the mechanic so they can better diagnose what’s wrong with your car, at the pharmacist and need clarity on the amount of pills you need to be taking and how often, or maybe you’re a home chef walking through ChinaTown exploring different ingredients to try at home and would like to learn more about them.  CoVoice will connect you with someone who could help.Minimum Viable Product / There are over 16 million Spanish speakers in America who don’t understand English (A population called LEP - Limited English Proficient), so to launch our MPV we’ll start with English/Spanish to keep our App development costs down. That being said, all rewards with CoVoice credit applies to Spanish/English translation.Covoice es una idea de aplicación de mi hermano, Regis Arzu, y yo, Joel Arzu, estadounidenses de primera generación e hijo de padres inmigrantes que dejaron Honduras por una vida mejor en Estados Unidos. Al crecer, nuestros padres solo hablaban español en esta gran tierra de oportunidades; y como padres, solo podemos imaginar las luchas por las que atravesaron tratando de darnos el mundo, pero se vieron reprimidos porque no hablaban inglés. Es por eso que creamos CoVoice, una aplicación que conecta a las personas que necesitan ayuda para comprender lo que alguien está diciendo, con alguien que puede ayudar a traducir. Nos gusta decir que es el Uber de conseguir un traductor.Entonces, si usted es un padre que quiere entender lo que el maestro de su hijo está diciendo en la conferencia de padres y maestros, o tal vez está en el farmacéutico y necesita claridad sobre la cantidad de píldoras que debe tomar y con qué frecuencia. CoVoice lo conectará con alguien que pueda ayudarlo.Producto Mínimo Viable / Hay más de 16 millones de hispanohablantes en Estados Unidos que no entienden inglés (una población llamada LEP - Dominio limitado del inglés), por lo que para lanzar nuestro MPV comenzaremos con inglés / español para mantener bajos los costos de desarrollo de nuestra aplicación. Dicho esto, todas las recompensas con crédito de CoVoice se aplican a la traducción al español / inglés.",

                "Title": "Wild Streets - Green Your City With Augmented Reality",
                "Text": "Wild Streets is a free augmented reality app that combines scientific data and high-quality 3D models of trees and plants to allow people to co-create the green, inclusive cities of tomorrow. More than ever, we need cities that offer green, healthy, usable spaces from micro parks sprinkled across neighbourhoods to green high-streets and super bicycle pathways connecting every corner of a city - and they ought to be shaped by the people they are intended for. Wild Streets is a tool that will help people reimagine their cities. It celebrates people’s differences and enables place-makers in creating spaces that unify and incorporates the needs and wishes of all. The app takes public engagement and awareness building on the benefits of urban nature to a whole new level.At the same time, Wild Streets harnesses the power of aggregated social data to inform decision-makers and planners about locals' preferences for green infrastructure - putting citizens at the centre of urban development. Limits to funding, awareness, and time are interrelated factors that compromise the quality of urban greening as they impede the decision-making of everyone involved. Wild Streets offers a cost- and time-effective tool that enables municipalities, organisations, and companies of all budgets to meet citizens at street level.   It's an ambitious project. That's why we've teamed up with two award-winning companies, Norgram and Set Snail, who have the expertise needed to bring the Wild Streets vision to life. We're also proud to be joining forces with i-Tree and Treeconomics, both drivers in the UK and internationally of the study of the multi-dimensional benefits of urban trees. To ensure that the app and our services are designed in a way that enables us to meet our objectives, we've assembled three incredible subject-focused advisory boards. A supervisory board will help us grow our geographical reach and scope in an organic and sustainable manWild Streets is a not-for-profit association registered in Denmark (CVR no. 39872595). Imagine if you could adapt your city right here and now; if those dull, grey streets could be your canvas. The work commute could be as pleasant as a walk in the park. Your surroundings could be tailored to suit your everyday needs for places to take a break, eat that lunch, let the kids roam around safely, and exercise in a calm setting with cleaner, healthier air. Those familiar spaces could look and feel like they never have before.Using Apple's augmented reality technology, the Wild Streets app will blur the line between how our cities are and what could be. We're inviting you to green your streets, squares, bike paths, back alleys, rooftops, and every other little opportune corner of your city, with lush, beautiful 3D vector trees and plants. The app will be compatible with iOS and Android devices.Besides having fun creating the city of your dreams, we want you to share it with the world. Wild Streets allows other people to step into your ideas by letting them reload your green creation at the same location, comment on it, iterate on the design, and share it with even more people including those in a position to make it happen. By including users' social data, we are also bridging the gap between locals, those who design our public spaces, and those who have the final say about their development. No more publicly displayed still images showing picture-perfect renders of urban landscapes nobody had a say on: planners will be able to see what people really want - across genders, ages, ethnicity - and people will be able to take official proposals to the test in the real-time world.Welcome to the green, inclusive cities of tomorrow!If we can harness our collective imagination and show it to the world, we don't need to accept the way things are, or even tweak the details. It's high time for a step-change into the future we want to live in. How green could your city be, how would it feel to think of streets as parks, how would it change the way you and your family live now and into a climate uncertain future?In 2020, the world as we know it changed for most of us. It got a lot smaller in many ways, and we have been forced to interact differently with our surroundings. The quality of our neighborhoods, access to nature, and the feeling of a space have all proven to be critical factors to people's mental and physical health in a time where lockdowns have mainly kept us at home or in our immediate surroundings.As we gradually adapt to new normals and return to old ones, these factors are likely to play a big role in how we perceive and make use of our cities. It has become clear that (nearby) access to green space for exercise, social gathering, and quiet self-reflection is scarce at best. And the design of such spaces is narrow and not accommodating the needs of everyone. People's awareness of the quality of the air they breathe has also come into focus, or there is at least ample opportunity to instill it.Allowing locals to shape their neighbourhoods and the places they work and play according to their needs is perhaps more than ever a timely opportunity to shape inclusive, considered cities. With the significant loss of power that people have experienced over their everyday life in 2020, there is a new willingness to take part in the reshaping of urban spaces - co-creation has the potential to empower people to take control of this process.The current crisis has amplified the reasons why the design of our cities is not fit to deal with what remains one of the greatest challenges of our time. Climate change has a visible impact on our lives, with urban temperatures fluctuating between extremes and nature in an unprecedented decline. Many cities are hotspots of biodiversity and use natural solutions to keep cool, prevent floods, deflect pollution, and calm winds. Today, nine in ten people worldwide live in places where air pollution levels exceed guideline limits by the World Health Organization, causing more than 7 million deaths every year. With the world’s urban population continuing its rapid climb to 68 percent by 2050, the transformation towards green, low-carbon cities is critical.Urban forests and nature in general, play a pivotal role in this, but current planting efforts in many cities are not happening at the rate they could. Wherever people have been given a voice in planning their city through measures such as participatory budgeting, there has been a clear call for greener surroundings. These can't be only top-down decisions either, the people who live in and use the streets every day need to have a say, and have a sense of ownership over what for some is their garden. There is an urgent need for solutions that enable the co-creation of tomorrow’s sustainable, green cities in the image of the people that inhabits them and that supports the rising willingness and activism among citizens to help bring about this transition. To that willingness, we offer Wild Streets.Utilising the revolutionary possibilities of AR (augmented reality), Wild Streets will enable users to green any location in real-time with simple drag’n’drop of true-to-scale 3D plants, trees, and street fixtures to whatever surroundings they view through their mobile device. Just like other AR apps, Wild Streets will measure relative heights, depths, and distances, presenting users with realistic limitations to where items can be placed. Ultimately, Wild Streets will allow users to experience their own and others' green designs, take selfies of themselves in it and share it with the world on social media.  The functionalities of Wild Streets are straightforward! The following mock-ups are concept sketches of the app's design that help us communicate the project with knowledge partners, advisory board members, and our B2B network. The final UI and UX designs will be developed by our talented development team and will look very different from these sketches, in terms of both visuals and wording, but this is how the concept works:We have made a prototype that demonstrates a simplified, raw version of the tree-placing functionality, how detailed the 3D vector trees are, and how easily one can reimagine any space. However, it is but a proof-of-principle prototype, and the full version of the app will look and feel completely different both in terms of design and the resolution and detailing of the trees, and feature many additional functionalities.To give users the most realistic experience, we'll be working with the award-winning vegetation software of Speedtree to create 3D trees and plants vectors. Think Avatar and Star Wars and their incredible landscapes, those are the quality of Speedtree's vector models! Using their software, we can model stunning, lifelike trees and plants as it taps into substantive databases of textures, enables the configuration of species-specific characteristics such as leaves, flowers, seeds, height, spread, branch length, branching angles, and bark texture. It is also possible to change the season, add wind effects as well as directional lighting on leaves and the tree surface. Believe us, it's immersive - you'll find yourself trying to touch the trees! Taking a stroll in a green space is lovely, but placing a bench amongst it would open up loads of new ways to spend time there. It's not surprising that greenery and street fixtures are closely related design parameters for urban planning. The selection of greenery for a location may very well depend on its intended purpose and hence any placed furniture and fixtures.In general, preferences to street fixtures vary substantially across demographic groups and life situations; elderly are likely to need more comfortable seating compared to children who generally want something fun to play on! Including street furniture in the app enables considered placemaking - and will help planners understand what people need and want and from their city.This is why we'll be continuously collaborating with environmentally conscious producers of seriously smart (and stylish!) solutions for outdoor benches, cycle parking, street separators, playground- and sports facilities, and other elements that just make a city work better. We will have the same high requirements for the visual quality of the 3D models of these products as we do for our tree and plant vectors.  The more we speak to people about Wild Streets, the more potential opportunities come up for things it makes possible. Organisations representing a wide range of urban interests, along with councils and companies in the business of placemaking are keen to use Wild Streets to create awareness about their work and to help them achieve their goals. Here're just a few examples of uses of the app:What makes Wild Streets so powerful - and ambitious! - is its usage of high-quality, and to the extent possible, real-time data. The app uses locally sourced data to make geo-specific recommendations for greenery that will thrive based on climate and ecology. Why does that matter? While it's clear that mango trees won't be too happy in the cold Scandinavian winter, it may surprise you to know to what extent choosing the right tree for the right place can have huge beneficial impacts on your neighbourhood. Research shows that trees have the ability to significantly reduce the risk of flooding, improve air quality, bring back wildlife, grow food, increase the amenity value, reduce temperature extremes and help people cope with stress - just to mention a few amazing features. Our demands to the data we use are critical for the overall usability of the app, for making it a trustworthy source for councils and place makers, and what distinguishes it from gimmicky AR apps. At launch, the algorithm powering the Wild Streets app will feature a selection of carefully considered indicators from well renowned and trusted data sources to suggest the right trees for the right place. We have prioritised these indicators based on in-depth conversations with foresters and researchers. Over time, we aspire to expand our algorithm with indicators expressive of more structurally complicated site-specific conditions as well as estimated benefits from tree planting.Creating awarenessOur algorithm will be hard at work in the background, processing thousands of data entries, while leaving you to play and have fun designing your city. We know from experience that communicating knowledge on sustainability is an incredibly hard task; the issues are complex and their implications are difficult to cope with. If we were to present people with technical information on all of the specific challenges and conditions of a location that they're thinking about greening, we'd lose 95 percent of them. And we want to get everybody excited and involved in greening up their cities! Key to the development of the Wild Streets app has therefore been to understand what tickles people when it comes to urban placemaking, and to partner up with the best strategic design team out there. With a laser focus on engagement, Wild Streets will seamlessly navigate users through the human and ecological benefits of their amazing designs. Of course, there will also be opt-in options for more detailed information for users who are interested. Managing expectationsThrough our many conversations with people in the urban planning field, it has become clear that an integrated in-app measure is needed to cope with people's expectations of a design created with Wild Streets. Because the reality is that the app and its data do not offer a blueprint for what is actually possible without the consideration of an experienced forester, and no matter how wonderful a design turns out and how many likes it gets on social media, no one is obligated to make it happen. That said, seeing is believing, and Wild Streets brings ideas so much closer to reality.Wild Streets uses the best available data to present users with flora that are likely to suit local site conditions and help tackle local challenges. We are developing a 'Confidence Index' that will give a transparent picture of the availability and quality of data for any given location. Through this index, we are also hoping to encourage more data collection and entrepreneurship. Design campaigns are tailored, in-app areas made for design surveys of specific geographical locations, and with respect to special social and/or environmental concerns. In a nutshell, design campaigns invite the public to have a direct say in current/ongoing greening projects. They feature tailored pop-up messages, surveys, and optimised tree/plant bundles for a specific theme. Actually, there will be many more available features and we'll keep adding more as we go!This feature of the app has been designed with councils, architects, and developers in mind to do good public engagement for local greening and building projects from the hyper-local level to master-planning. Users will be able to have a say on what they would like to have featured in an area, and respond to and iterate upon design proposals right at the beginning of the process.A campaign can have multiple rounds of engagement! For example, citizens can be asked to provide general ideas for a place or give feedback on pre-commissioned landscape design, then once all that feedback has been digested by planners, citizens can have another go on an optimised design. In this way, you increase people's sense of ownership of a place and the quality of the result. People are likely to be more committed to the process, and in using and looking after the place which is created as a result.  Expect a lot of augmented reality fun with app-wide global campaigns as well, where we will focus on international awareness days celebrating nature, climate, biodiversity, urbanism, sports as well as physical and mental health. You will never know what surprises we might let loose when placing a tree!As important and powerful as the engagement and awareness experience is from just using the app, the true value of Wild Streets is in the data it collects and the output it generates. We want people's beautiful designs and ideas for their cities to go somewhere where change can happen. Based on the conversations we've had with many future users, we're launching the app with different outputs tailored to citizens and to clients (municipalities, organisations, companies). Visual outputsCitizensThe visual output available to people will be fairly simple as their interest mainly is in experiencing their own and other users' designs in real-time and in formats commonly shared on social media. By enabling people to share high-quality videos or photos ('selfie' or not), it inspires others to have a say. This raises the bar of ambition for decision-makers, and having seen what people need and want, there is a public accountability to use that knowledge and make ideas come to life. It changes the conversation between citizens and councils from opposition to proposition, to help make supporting voices as loud as protesting ones are today. ClientsClients as a group have more differing needs in the formats they access and review users' design submissions in, depending on their profession. How clients can explore the app's output matters a great deal to the potential societal impact of Wild Streets. The diagram below illustrates the various types of visual output formats that future users have expressed interest in. Clients also get access to a dashboard through which they can receive your designs, showing what green space the people want and where, and how much value all the ideas would bring if they were made. Shared designs and some basic aggregated info about the characteristics of the people who made them give organisations and councils everywhere a really useful database to make better decisions about green spaces for a particular community. So that even if there are few designs shared in a particular place or project, designers might know, for example, that people of a certain sort of age, ethnicity, and gender tend to prefer spaces that feel safe, smell and look beautiful, have playgrounds, and have amazing green pathways for sports.Data output Citizens & clientsThe data output presented to the users is carefully chosen to be engaging but not to overwhelm and risk that they don't complete a design or delete the app. The app will suggest other local designs for the user to explore based not only on geographic location but also on shared social characteristics, building a local awareness of what the community wants. For awareness-raising and engagement, the app will feature estimated values of the ecosystem services delivered by the design.ClientsAlongside the visual design recommendations from users, Wild Streets will also generate data useful to clients. These include the ecosystem services of a user's designs and the cumulative effect of these for a defined geographic area.The app collects demographic data on age, gender, nationality, ethnicity, location, and whether people have children or live with handicaps. By cross-referencing preferences for greenery; such as formality, naturalism, species choice, or functionality with information about the types of users that preferred them, a designer/planner can better cater to the needs of different communities or types of individuals.Such data will be available in aggregated form to allow clients to see whether a survey campaign has been inclusive or reached the desired demographic groups. Naturally, data protection and privacy are key, and users' personal information will be protected.It's gonna be a learning curve, for sure, as to what kind of output people need to make Wild Streets serve them best. Luckily, the app collects plenty of data behind the scenes that we can use to continuously create new exiting outputs to accommodate people's wishesIrrespective of your motivations for using the app, we will do everything we can to help make citizens' visions come true. Not only does anyone working in not-for-profit placemaking have free, unlimited access to citizens' designs, but the real magic is unlocked when they can see what sort of people make what sort of designs (free as well!). That's the foundation for inclusive placemaking. A lot of effort will be put into distributing these insights and visuals to our growing international network of councils and organisations enabling them to make considered decisions. And don't worry, we take privacy very seriously.   It is thanks to in-depth conversations with placemakers from councils, interested organisations, and companies - the people who work on the ground and directly with citizens on greening our cities - that Wild Streets looks the way it does today. Going forward, it makes sense to us that those who are going to apply the app also should have a strong say on what it has to offer. We are inviting our community of placemakers to co-create the app and the complementing services, be part of beta-testing, and have a real impact on the product development process. We believe this will increase the chances for citizens' designs to be realised.Wild Streets will be globally available from its release day. However, it is planned to officially launch in the UK where the concept was born with the most complete data, most tree species, the highest confidence index and many partnerships for data, grassroots engagement, and professional deployment. A soft launch will follow shortly after in a select city in the US. These locations will have the highest 'Confidence Index' (data coverage and quality) and hence see a higher accuracy of the app's tree-selection tool and ecosystem benefit calculations. As one example: while the app is powered with global air quality data from Plume Labs, a recognised global data provider, UK/US data authorities will provide more precise local information.The implications for the app's usability elsewhere straight after launch depend on whether or not a country belongs to the same 'world climate region' as the UK - the light green area in the map below. These areas stand a good chance of being hospitable to the initial set of trees, though those species might not be the most obvious choices for the local ecology.While our global data providers feed the app with location-specific information, certain assumptions will be made for countries belonging to the UK's 'cool temperate moist' region. We may also be able to make certain assumptions for other regions with similar hardiness characteristics. This will be decided following advice from our Scientific Advisory Board and Knowledge Partners.Any country belonging to the other world climate regions will see a lower Confidence Index and will still be able to access a selection of tree species that are known to those regions. However, the selection tool will not be 'active' as data coverage is simply too low to make an informed recommendation. For these countries, Wild Streets will, nevertheless, still be a powerful engagement and placemaking tool.We have defined 1 year from funding being secured until the fully tested app is ready for release. In the testing stages, councils, companies, and organizations in our network will get the chance to apply Wild Streets in real life and help us perfect the app. Do you want to get your hands on the beta-version too? Sign up for our newsletter here. Wild Streets is an ambitious project using some of the best people in their fields - as you might have suspected by now, it is not possible to develop a full-scale version of the app for just €50.000. In fact, the whole project is estimated to cost €1.628.000. These numbers have been subject to countless revisions as we have optimized our MVP (minimum viable product), giving enough space for our team of developers to work with Apple and our knowledge/data providers to get the app working flawlessly. Here's how we'll spend the money: With your help, we can get the work started and get the funding ball rolling. Once you pledge, you'll be invited to join a Substack space, where we'll share exclusive behind-the-scenes videos from the developers' desk, live streams with the Wild Streets team, and other goodies including future features that we're currently keeping under wraps. You'll also get a real say in the development of the app from day 1 through polls and demos. This is a tool for co-design, and we'll be co-designing the app itself too.For every stretch goal we reach, we'll make additional features available or enhance existing ones - available at launch or within 1 year thereof.  Once we've reached Goal 10, we'll announce additional goals and the exciting features they come with.  In addition to Kickstarter, we're also pursuing large sponsors to meet the full funding we need to create and launch. We will keep you updated on our funding progress outside Kickstarter, so you can how close we are to our goals.What if we collect more than we need? The more funding we get, the more we have to develop additional features and services to kick Wild Streets off with and to plan amazing launch events with. Wild Streets is a not-for-profit organization and everything we earn will be funneled into enhancing the user experience, our offerings to placemakers, and launching full data versions of the app in other countries.      When pledging to Wild Streets, you are pledging towards your future. Our Kickstarter rewards are all connected to the Wild Streets app, meaning by default that no rewards become available before the full app is fully financed and developed. But when it is ready, there will be a treasure chest of rewards. Below you will see the rewards available - once you make a pledge, we invite you to become a lifetime member of our community, meaning that you will get early access to new releases, pre-sets, fun filters and animated hidden surprises, green-screen persona appearances (oh yes!), and many more engaging surprises. We will also share exclusive behind-the-scenes and making-of videos during the development of the app. Head to our website at www.wildstreets.org if you're interested in a personalised reward or already have an idea for a green commissioned project.We are currently a small team of two but it feels like we are many more because of our committed network and advisors with huge collective experience and wisdom between them. Once our budget is secured, our team will grow to five as we will need an innovative developer who can continue the product development, a data-wizard, and a social media/PR whirlwind fluent in engagement.Something that does not make sense? Or simply curious to know more? Maybe you (and your neighborhood) want to be part of the beta-testing community, or you're sitting on data that could benefit the app? Or maybe you have a specific idea for collaboration.Feel free to reach out to us with any inquiry - big or small - by writing us at founder@wildstreets.org or calling us at +45 31 20 74 90.",

                "Text": "Hello people, wir wollen den gesamten dritten Wirtschaftssektor digitalisieren. Was bedeutet das? Nun, Deutschland ist ein Land, welches von Dienstleistungen geprägt ist; beim Friseurbesuch, im Nagelstudio, in einer Therme, in einer Sauna oder beim Handwerker, alles sind Dienstleistungen.  Um diese Dienstleistungen und viele mehr in Anspruch zu nehmen, wird oft ein Termin benötigt, welcher nach wie vor noch überwiegend am Telefon vereinbart wird und dieses Vorgehen kostet Zeit, Geld und kann die Qualität der Dienstleistung mindern. Mit unserer App soll sich das ändern!Laut einer Umfrage, welche von der Forsa durchgeführt wurde, warten viele Menschen in Deutschland nur darauf, Dienstleistungen im Internet zu buchen. Wir haben dafür eine Marktplatz-Lösung entwickelt, welche dies ermöglichen soll und auf vollständiger Transparenz basiert. Der Kunde kann sich jedes Angebot, von jedem Dienstleister und mit allen Extras anschauen und vergleichen, bis er das richtige Angebot gefunden hat. Der Dienstleister hingegen hat nur einen monatlichen Festpreis zu zahlen und braucht somit keine Angst vor versteckten Mehrkosten haben und kann die Preise im Internet genau so anbieten wie vor Ort. Hinzu kommt, dass wir die wichtigsten drei Aspekte, welche sich die befragten gewünscht umgesetzt haben, diese sind: 1.  Die Kunden wünschen sich eine hohe Überschaubarkeit: ServiceAtHome bietet durch seinen Aufbau eine fast intuitive Nutzung sodass unser Marktplatz für Dienstleistungen einem Marktplatz für Produkte gleicht.2. An zweiter Stelle ist die durchgängige Erreichbarkeit des Marktplatzes und die 24/7-Möglichkeit der Terminbuchung gefordert. ServiceAtHome ist durch seine online Präsenz immer erreichbar und selbst bei Störungen oder anbahnenden Störungen sind bereits Alternativen vorbereitet und werden für eine gute Erreichbarkeit der Seite eingesetzt.3. Die drittstärkste Forderung von Kunden ist, dass eine Terminbuchung online Zeit spart im Vergleich zu den üblichen oft genutzten Telefonen. ServiceAtHome ermöglicht einen Termin zu buchen in nur wenigen Klicks. Die Terminbestätigung erhält sowohl der Kunde als auch der Dienstleister direkt nach der Bezahlung.Mit der neuen App können wir alle Aspekte und noch vieles mehr noch besser umsetzen. So wird auch eine Integrierung des Termins in einem digitalen Kalender eines Drittanbieters, von Kunden als Pluspunkt gesehen, was ebenfalls eingebaut werden soll.Der nächste positive Effekt, welcher entsteht, ist der, dass bei vielen kleineren Dienstleistern der Arbeitsprozess durch ein Telefonklingeln gestört wird. Mit unserer App kann man sich voll und ganz auf den Kunden konzentrieren und die höchste Qualität erbringen. Abschließend wollen wir auch die Werbung und das Marketing der Dienstleister übernehmen und das \"zusammen\" machen. So wollen wir verschiedene Dienstleister in Marketing-Kampagnen von ServiceAtHome integrieren und z.B. mit den Dienstleistern auf Social Media auftreten oder Plakatwerbung betreiben.",

                "Title": "AquaX10 - Water Filtration for Sailing Boats",
                "Text": "Imagine sailing without thinking about the management of your water supply. Imagine being totally independent because you have a system on your boat that up-cycles your used water and returns clean water.Imagine the freedom of sailing wherever you want with an AquaX10 on your boat.  Being free to sail wherever you want, whenever you want, while protecting the local resources is our definition of freedom. As we are sailors ourselves, we permanently think about improving the sailing experience and the ecological impact of our beloved passion.Making your sailing experience more exciting, smooth and sustainable is the goal that we're dedicated to. Using the shower on a boat can be a challenging experince. As water is scarce you have to shower as quick as possible.  And even by shortening the timespan of this beloved luxury, you will run out of water as your crew also has to wash the salt out of their hair and skin. It's always a limiting factor.For us and our sailor friends it always saddened us when, we had to leave a beautiful sunset in a bay to sail to a crammed, expensive Marina, just because we've run out of fresh water.  So, our idea was: Let's start to improve the largest water consumer unit on a boat. And this is your shower.What if we could multiply the amount of  water on our boat? Maybe by up to 10x ? We can reach this goal by adjusting the way your shower works!Our concept states:If we don't want to dumb precious water in the sea we need to close the water cycle in your boat. This will be done with our system.Finally, this concept will give us way more options in terms of flexibility and sailing destinations.So we developed the AquaX10 . Your solution to multiply the amount of clean and fresh water on your boat. With the AquaX10 you extend the freedom of your sailing trips.  No longer will you have to leave a bay or that magic spot where you want to stay. Multiply your fresh water and be free. This is our take on sustainable sailing. We offer an environmentally-friendly product which recycles sweet water that would otherwise be pumped into the sea and therefore be lost to the salt water.The AquaX10 is our contribution to saving precious sweet water whilst sailing. Giving you the freedom of having a big topic off your To-Do list. How to get fresh and clean water. The AquaX10 takes care of that for you. For a long time electricity and water have been the major resources that limited our sailing experience. In the last years, the electricity issue has been widely solved with solar panels and wind generators. Now we will solve the last limiting factor on your boat. Water!Backing this campaign and supporting the AquaX10 will give you the opportunity to contribute to a better personal sailing experience and a cleaner environment. Using our advanced filtration techniques will give you fresh and pure water on your boat for an entire trip. And the best is yet to come. Prototypes of the AquaX10 are already installed on sailing boats.Now we're in the process of testing, improving and adjusting them on our sailing boat and the boats of our families and friends. This means, we're going through the final R&D process.  Our system produces fresh water and the Prototype is working as planned. If we achieve our funding goal on Kickstarter, we can start to develop this system into a  smarter and automatized version for you. We will develop a system that is more comfortable and includes an easy to use Touch-Display System.We'll finish the process of testing and adjusting the Prototypes, finetuning  of the filters and development of our controller in the end of winter 2021.Our confidence in the projected timeline is strong, With your backing, we'll be on track to start shipping products to backers during Q2/2022. We are excited to see Kickstarter backers with our AquaX10 in harbours around the world soon!With the AquaX10 we focus on the water cycle e.g. in the shower of your boat. We make sure that every drop of water is used.  The setup provides you with a specialized system which includes active coal filtration techniques to clean your water to the size of 0,01 µm. This is even smaller than the size of bacteria or, in times of COVID, the size of a virus spore.  Our system and its single components are designed and optimized for boats.We tested many setups considering major factors of the marine environment like energy, water flow, internal pressure, outside temperature, humidity and many more.This iteration process brought us to the setup we're now using in the AquaX10.All the substances in your waste water have to go through multiple filtration and cleaning sequences in the AquaX10. The waste water will be filtered and the clean result goes back to your fresh water tank. Through this internal cycle, we make sure that the system will be clean and you get up to 10 x the amount of water from your tank.With the integration of the AquaX10 you create a water circuit within your boat which will provide fresh water for you and your Crew. Wherever you are. Whenever you want. The filters can clean up to 10.000 litres of sweet water before they have to be changed. You can be sure to have clean water on your boat that can be used to shower, etc.First things first: Our shipping guarantee to youWe've already negotiated resources for production facilities and we work with an experienced partner from the industry. As we've mentioned above: We'll finish the process of testing and adjusting the Prototypes, fine tuning of the filters and development of our controller in the end of winter 2021. With your support we'll be able start the production of the AquaX10 systems.The revolutionary size and positioning of the AquaX10 systemWe all know one thing for sure.Size matters.Especially on a boat. Ca. zum Gewicht und den Abmessungen schreibenThe AquaX10 system is designed in accordance with the space limitations on sailing yachts. We took great care in making sure that we develop a system that is as small and flexible as possible. Using the limited space you have on your boat to its best possible use.But we didn't stop there. We constructed the inner life of the AquaX10 as solid as possible. The AquaX10 is as flexible as you need it to be.To make life easy for you, the AquaX10 is a fully deployable solution.  With our package you will be able to set up a functioning system on your boat.  If you want to, you can do this by yourself. We provide the following components in the Starter Packs offered here.The complete projected package in one picture Our goal with this Kickstrater Campaign is to get enough funding for the next step in the development of the AquaX10.  Through your support we will go further to make the system smarter and easier to use. As a part of the kIckstarter campaign your package will include the next evolutionary step of the AquaX10. The components listed below will be additionally realized through the funding of this campaign.All the components you need to set up the whole system, like tubes, fittings, connectors, technical equipment etc. will be in the package that we deliver to you.All parts have generously been calculated to make sure that you don't run out of tubes, connectors, etc. Backups are included.All our backers will receive a packing list, installation guide and installation assistance and services. If you face an obstacle we'll be there for you. In the unlikely case that something is missing or too short, send us an E-Mail and we will send whatever is missing.Water Analysis Certificates (Prototype)Waste, pollution and microsplastics have become a massively increasing problem in the ocean.   Making sure that sailing will be as sustainable as possible, it is our mission to create solutions that protect the environment and benefit you - our sailor friends.The AquaX10 is one big piece of the puzzle to make your sailing experience sustainable and comfortable. But we don't stop there.Our company supports water protection NGOs like Viva con Agua on a monthly basis.We see it as our obligation to contribute to the change that is necessary to protect the environment.The AquaX10 is only the start of our journey. We believe that sailing and everything that accompanies this experience should be as smooth and easy as possible.  Therefore, we launch the AquaX10 as the building brick of the Marine Infinite Platform.

In order to stop further outbreaks and save lives, testing must continue for the foreseeable future. And experts recommend COVID-19 testing becomes routine. “As more contagious coronavirus variants emerge and lockdown measures are relaxed, the nation needs to intensify, not scale back, nationwide testing efforts.” - Dr Jennifer B. Nuzzo, Emily N. Pond, epidemiologists, Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center (https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/12/opinion/need-covid-tests.html)“If someone’s at an increased risk for severe illness or has close contact with someone who’s at an increased risk for severe illness, I think getting tested regularly is smart,” - Suzanne Pham, MD, medical director of the COVID-19 response team at Weiss Memorial Hospital, Chicago  (https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/covid-testing)\n \"Eventually, testing will be normalized\" (https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/covid-testing)\n It is still possible to contract and spread COVID-19 when you are double vaccinated, and the Delta variant of the infection is more likely than other variants to spread through unvaccinated people (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02187-1)*If you are uninsured, it is also significantly more complicated to locate and book a COVID-19 test, because some healthcare providers will not allow patients to book without insurance*(App prototype.

                "Title": "QBii: The Multi-Function Service Robot",
                "Text": "What if everyone could have a robot that was actually many robots in one?This exciting idea led us to create QBii, an affordable, multi-functional and expandable service robot. While most other robots are limited to only one function, QBii performs a host of useful tasks to make your life easier.Carry: For such a small robot, QBii can carry surprisingly heavy items (up to 50lb). This allows QBii to help you move things like groceries, boxes, laundry, bins and furniture.Clean: Like many service robots, QBii can clean your floors. The difference is, QBii will let you use the brooms, mops and dusters you already own. QBii is able to clean floors in workplaces as well. You will need the Broom Adapter Kit add-on to attach cleaning tools to QBii. QBii has been tested with vacuum cleaners as well. A separate adapter for wand-style vacuum cleaners is planned (not part of this campaign) and will become available in the near future.Cart: Amazingly, this 9-pound robot can tow up to 200 lb. This lets you convert almost any utility cart (like this one) into a robotic cart.You will need the Cart Hitch Kit add-on to attach utility carts to QBii. Climb: QBii is expandable, allowing you to use it as a platform to develop your own projects. In fact, this expansion capability has allowed us to develop ROSA, the Robotic Stairclimbing Assistant.ROSA is under development and is expected to be available by mid-2022. ROSA is not part of this campaign.QBii's optional Expansion Port allows you to connect external electronic devices (e.g., sensors), an auxiliary third motor, and an external power port. Mounting holes (1/4-20) let you mount auxiliary hardware, such as an action camera (not included) for teleoperation or inspections tasks.A Lidar Sensor Array allows QBii to locate itself in its environment in order to improve path following performance. These sensors also enable advanced capabilities like Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM).The Expansion Port (including third motor controller) and Lidar Sensor Array are part of the Expansion Kit add-on.OverviewTo operate QBii, you will use the QRS Control App, which runs on smartphones and tablets (not included). The Control App allows you to run QBii in teleoperation mode ('joystick' mode) or in autonomous mode ('path following'). You can use the built-in Path Editor to create and run customized paths.No lines on the floor! No embedded cables! QBii can operate autonomously without any infrastructure changes to your home or workplace.Current FunctionalityThe current functionality of the Control App and how it relates to QBii's various capabilities is illustrated in the series of videos below:Accessing the App: The App can be installed on a smartphone or tablet. Connecting to the Robot: The App and robot interact using a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) client/server protocol. You will need to connect the App to your robot in order to operate it.Joystick Mode: In teleoperation (or 'joystick') mode, you can use the App to drive the robot directly.Joystick Mode in Cart (or Any) Configuration: Joystick Mode works regardless of how the robot is configured, i.e., by itself, carrying a load, cleaning the floor, or towing a cart. Joystick Mode lets you operate the robot directly in any of these configurations. To illustrate this point, this video shows Joystick while in 'cart' configuration.Creating a Path: The most powerful feature of the Control App is that it lets you create, save, and run robot paths. Using the Path Editor, these paths are built up as a series of from simple segments (e.g., \"Drive\", \"Turn\"). You can name and save your paths to be reused later. In this video we create a simple path called \"Zig\" to illustrate the process.Running a Path: Using its Path Running ('Map') screen, the Control App provides a graphical representation of a saved path. You can then \"press play\" and have the robot run this path. The App shows you a real-time update of the robot's actual position as it executes the path.  This video shows the robot running the simple 'Zig' path.Using a Path to Carry a Bin: As with Joystick Mode, Path Following Mode is independent of how the robot is configured. To illustrate this point, this video shows how the simple 'Zig' path we created in an earlier video can be used to direct QBii to deliver a bin to a specific location.  Using a Path to Clean the Floor: In this example we've equipped QBii with a floor sweeper. We then ran the 'Zig' test path to show how reusable paths can be used for any purpose, including cleaning the floor. In an actual application, more complex floor sweeping patterns can be constructed. Different patterns can be used for different parts of your house or building.   Using a Path to Tow A Cart: In this final example we've attached QBii to a cart. Again, the 'Zig' test path is used to show how a robotic cart can be sent on a specific route from A to B.    Planned Improvements to the Control AppThe functionality of the Control App (Rev 2), as shown in our project videos above, exists and has been tested. However, we are in the process of making improvements. Plans for Rev 3 include the following:Our goal is to have Rev 3 of the Control App coincide with delivery of Rev 3 QBii units as part of this campaign.Since QBii is uniquely multi-functional, it is ideal for both home or work, and is a versatile tool for educators and hobbyists alike.To offer you the best possible value, we are providing the option of selecting the QBii Robot Kit as your pledge reward.  The Kit includes all the components needed for a complete, fully functional QBii robot, which you can assemble yourself. The Kit comes together using simple hand tools and no soldering is required. This option is ideal for hobbyists, DIYers, STEM educators/students, or anyone who enjoys hands-on projects.But don't worry. If assembly isn't your thing, we'll do it for you (see Assembly Add-on). *Important note* Battery charger AC plug is compatible with North American electrical outlets. Adapters for non-North American outlets are not included.Most of our junior engineers and developers have participated on high school robotics teams. Our founder, Dr. Frank Naccarato, was also a robotics mentor for many years. We have benefitted from STEM-based curriculum. This campaign is an opportunity to give back. That's why we've added a reward tier that allows backers to contribute towards our donation of QBii Robot Kits to schools. For every 10 backers at this level, we will build a Kit for the express purpose of donating it to an academic institution.For the past year and a half, we have designed, fabricated and tested two prior generations of prototypes: Rev 1 (proof-of-concept) and Rev 2 (fully functional). In fact, all the photos and videos you see here are of Rev 2 prototypes.A successful campaign will allow us to reach the following development milestones:Tasks involving lifting, pushing and carrying (e.g., lifting laundry, carrying groceries, cleaning the floor) are often challenging, especially for seniors and people with limited mobility. On stairs, performing these tasks becomes laborious at best and dangerous at worst, potentially leading to serious injury (falls, back strain, etc.).Quantum Robotic Systems Inc. (QRS) is a Toronto-based company that addresses this problem by making unique mobile autonomous robots. QRS has developed and patented a novel stair-climbing technology that allows users to carry heavy, bulky loads up and down stairs in an easier, faster and safer way. The company has incorporated this technology into its Robotic Stairclimbing Assistant (ROSA), a service robot that can carry things while climbing up and down stairs. QRS was founded by Dr. Frank Naccarato. Frank is an inventor, entrepreneur, consultant and professor with over 30 years’ experience in R&D and product development. After completing his doctorate in robotics at the University of Toronto’s Institute for Aerospace Studies, Dr. Naccarato worked as a research engineer, designer, project manager and director of R&D. His past projects include a control algorithm developed for the International Space Station and a robotic testing machine for medical laboratories. One of the toughest challenges for a small technology start-up is finding a way to get early products out there, into the hands of real users, in a cost-feasible way. A successful campaign for QBii will give QRS just that opportunity. Kickstarter will allow us to realize our production ready design (Rev 3) and introduce it to the world on a large scale.We will also be able to demonstrate early market traction, which will allow us to leverage the sales realized through Kickstarter into further outside investment and additional government support for R&D.We will also be able to start negotiating volume rates for parts and materials, which will bring our manufacturing costs down.So, your support will have a major impact on our future success. It's a big deal! Thank you!",

You may stick an old photo to the inner side of the lid to remind you of who sends you this box or the precious moments of your life.The message sender could be anyone who knows the serial no. of the box and is able to use the internet. Actually the sender would usually be the one who gives the receiver this box as a gift. After all these thoughts floated in my head, I started to draft the sketch and all its relevant components. Then I started to buy things. I was thinking, there might be some existing attractive boxes being sold in the market and I didn't have to design a new one which would consume unnecessary resources and wouldn't be environmentally friendly. So I purchased the box, display, power module, Wi-Fi module...everything online.Upon receipt of those components, I started working on the programming of the website and the control module respectively.  Finally, I started to build the prototype.   Then, fortunately, it worked!I would like to share this prototype with everyone, so I decided to launch this project on Kickstarter, and hopefully, with the support from you guys, I would be able to commercialise this product. And I definitely know, from prototype to mass production, there is still a long way to go.And I also want to improve the design by adding other functions & modules.Lastly, it would be much appreciated that Magic Message Box could be on your list when you are considering sending a gift to someone you care about most.You may also scan the QR code or click on the link to take a glance at the website: https://qrgo.page.link/KMGsb  The videos below illustrate how to upload a message to Magic Message Box. ",

                "Text": "WE INVENTED AUGMENTED ANALOGAnalog Morphing Core is the name of a new and unique patented approach to electronic clipping circuits developed by Kernom. An Analog Morphing Core equipped device, like the RIDGE, controls the nonlinear elements of the clipping stage (traditionally diodes) by changing in real time their threshold, making them behave like a new kind of diode.It allows musicians to have access to a virtually infinite number of clipping options: symmetric, asymmetric, high headroom, very compressed, etc. in a single analog circuit, controlled by the unique Mood knob. Completely different from approaches such as modeling and switches between different diodes.The result is an extremely versatile and unique analog circuit. Analog, Augmented.Use the mood knob to select from the ultimate clean boost to a fully compressed overdriven sound. Ever dreamed of a heavily distorted sound, that would still react to your playing?Symmetric, asymmetric, high headroom, compressed … you decide.A never-ending journey through overdrive sound flavors.Choose between ultimate transparency at any grit level with the three EQ knobs at noon, or colour your sound using the powerful EQ section.Change the way the pedal reacts to your guitar with the PRE knob, how it interacts with your amp with the POST knob, how you cut through or blend in the mix with the MID knob. Punish the front end of your amp like never before thanks to the 30V maximum output voltage of the RIDGE and experience extreme dynamics.Here are some samples of how the RIDGE sounds. Just to make you wait until you get yours.Connect the RIDGE to your expression pedal and explore new possibilities. Adjust drive level, boost your mids, or blend two completely different tones together. The possibilities are endless.The RIDGE features an internal preset that can be used without the need to use an external device, accessible via the Preset footswitch. Rhythm and lead tone, clean and dirty, or any other combination: you have access to two sounds at any time. Simply hold the Preset footswitch for 2 seconds and save the current position of the knobs for later use.The RIDGE is entirely MIDI compatible. You can plug an external MIDI switcher to the RIDGE via mini jack to save and recall up to 128 different presets and cover all your overdrive needs. You can also connect the RIDGE to a third party controller (like the incredible Erae Touch from our friends at EMBODME) and change in real time its internal parameters to explore new ways to interact with overdrive.You can use all your instruments with The RIDGE: guitar, but also bass, synths and vocals. This is made possible thanks to the pedal’s adaptive input gain. You can choose between instrument level or line level at any time to use the RIDGE on all your tracks.We showed the RIDGE to professional musicians. Here is what they had to say about it!\"Want endless overdrive flavours from an analog circuit? This new pedal from the French startup aims to provide just that\"\"…the Kernom products are being made in a state-of-the-art factory in France that works on medical projects, so I’m expecting great build quality.\" \" ...this control could give you access to symmetric, asymmetric, high headroom, and compressed drive tones. That’s a lot of useful overdrive tones in one pedal.\"\"Kernom nous propose avec la RIDGE une nouvelle approche grâce à sa technologie brevetée Analog Morphing Core. Il s'agit pour faire simple d'un circuit d'écrêtage du signal qui reste 100% analogique et sur lequel Kernom a ajouté un variateur d'intensité numérique sur les éléments non-linéaires.\"\"RIDGE can provide unlimited clipping options and operate within 30V to obtain greater headroom.\" \"The circuitry includes their new Analog Morphing Core that is a new approach to clipping circuits.\"\"Le nom de cette très, très jeune entreprise innovante française pourrait vite entrer au panthéon d'une foule de musiciens à l’affût de solutions et matériels susceptibles de leur ouvrir de nouveaux champs de créativité.\"\"La marque française Kernom fait une entrée en fanfare dans le monde des effets avec la Ridge, une pédale d'overdrive augmentée.\"\"Unlimited clipping options in one analogue circuit\"The RIDGE comes in a vibrant and iconic color called Summit White. White is the sum of all colors, just like the RIDGE can deliver all the flavors of overdrive we all know and love.To celebrate the launch of the RIDGE on Kickstarter we also created an exclusive dark red finish that reacts beautifully to different lighting setups, going from a beautiful brown to a deep blood red. We called it Blood Rust. The Blood Rust RIDGE will only be available to Kickstarter backers. Grab one while you can!The casing was inspired by the architectural design language of modernism. It has a strong personality, but remains easy to operate. Every detail on the Ridge was a conscious decision. We started from a blank page to design an iconic product that would withstand the hardships of the road and decades of abuse.Kernom aims at providing musicians with the most reliable and performant products possible. Kernom products are manufactured in a state of the art factory in France that works on medical projects, a field where precision and reliability are of paramount importance.",

Platform is a freemium service aimed at being a creative and collaborative social networking application aimed at connecting individuals with projects and ideas to individuals that have the skill/monetary-based resources needed to make those projects and ideas a reality. It's a centralized virtual space for project collaborators (ex.  Artists, Designers, creators, and Visionaries). It's almost like Kickstarter as well, except people cannot only support projects financially, but they can also contribute to them with their skills.In a sense, Platform is a mix of Reddit's communal section, Instagram's interesting content, Tinder's matchmaking algorithm, and LinkedIn's job recruitment section; combined in hopes of creating a relaxed or perhaps creative community for people to diffuse and collaborate on projects big and small.Our team is comprised of 4 co-founders, 3 of which are recent Clarkson University graduates and one undergraduate. We started Platform because of a common issue all 4 of us faced from prior projects. The issue of finding project collaborators. Because of that shared issue we faced, we quickly realized that in a broader sense, other people also shared similar pains in finding people with shared interests who are passionate enough to join them on the adventure of creative collaboration.Upon the completion of the first iteration of our mobile app, we intend on generating revenues through access fees. access fees will be charged to Patent Attorneys, Studios,  Engineers and etc. These firms and occupations will be charged an access fee to provide their services to collaborators on Platform.Why service fees? So let's say a user has an idea for a book then connects with another user to write the book. What will they need? A publisher. So publishers could pay to have access to Platform collaborators who may need their services.  Patent attorneys and a variety of other people who will need access to Platform users. \n\n My team and I have been working on Platform for the past 2 years, but due to a variety of factors such as being underskilled and lacking access to financial resources we simply have no option other than to turn to the Kickstarter community for financial aid. We are currently looking to raise $262,780 in funding to kickstart our development and deployment of Platform for the duration of a year. Below is a list of our projected expenses:Upon reaching our funding goal, we will be hiring two full-stack developers within two weeks of reaching our goal.  Upon the success of our beta test, depending on how many users and connections are made on Platform, we'll start reaching out to Venture Capital firms for more funding to scale up development, marketing, and formally become a legal entity.We intend on giving out T-shirts with the Platform logo on them as a reward for your donations.",

                "Text": "If you have ever thought that LCD 3D printers should support large-scale industrial precision printing, with extraordinary user-centric smart functions, then we built a CyFantasy LCD 3D printer especially for you!We call it Cyfantasy LCD 3D Printer for good reasons. So far, the general LCD 3D printers on the market do not support large format requirements and usually sacrifice quality and precision to save costs. This is why we spent years developing prototypes and testing them until we came up with a tested and perfect final success formula: CyFantasy3D CY-OS01 is a light-curing LCD 3D printer for large format projects. Provides industrial precision and high-end smart functions at unprecedented speeds.Printing Videos(Keep Updated)#1#2It’s not just the speed, large format printing or the industrial precision performance. Those are definitely features that make the CyFantasy LCD 3D Printer unique. However, we’ve gone beyond that, adding five intelligent functions to a 3D Printer like no other.When the box of materials of the CyFantasy LCD 3D printer is running short of whichever material you’re using (it supports common resin, strong toughness resin and elastic resin, among other possible materials), the printer will automatically detect this shortage and it will also automatically refill it. What does this mean to you? You’ll save time and, more importantly, the consistency of the printing process and the integrity of the printing results are not affected by a sudden interruption and a disruptive refilling process.Removing the box of materials from a 3D printer to replace them is so old school. With the CyFantasy LCD 3D Printer’s world's first flash material replacement program, you can literally replace the material you’re using with a single click on the operation panel. Yes, really!3D printing should be a clean and precise process, leading to a pristine result. However, most 3D printers are not stable enough to do that—but the CyFantasy LCD 3D Printer is! The connecting rod of the printer's forming platform adopts an exclusive ball screw design that provides a steady printing experience, dramatically reducing vibration while printing, and extraordinarily improving the quality and detail of printed objects.  It looks like a scene from a futuristic science fiction movie, but it is actually another user-centric feature of this excellent printer. The cover of the CyFantasy LCD 3D printer is flipped in a smart way, with no need to manually open and close, so you can enjoy it more easily, and at the same time feel that you are using cutting-edge technology from the future to help your creative projects come to life!Technical features and functions make CyFantasy LCD 3D printers very smart and efficient. However, we also believe that the printer you use should be outstanding and amazing in every respect, which is very important. Therefore, unlike the typical and rigid rectangular box structure of ordinary 3D printers, we designed the printer as a high-end cyberpunk helmet. The point is: no matter how you look at it, there is no 3D printer like CyFantasy LCD 3D printer!You shouldn’t have to run a large manufacturing operation to enjoy industrial-grade precision. In our view, that’s not a luxury—it’s a requirement that any 3D printer should have. That’s why we tested the CyFantasy LCD 3D Printer for three months in dental clinics. We had to create a superb printer that could deliver superb results. We can now proudly say that the surface smoothness of what you create with our printer comfortably meets industrial-grade standards that can cater to different business needs.On the other hand, the LCD light-curing printer platform is also extremely sturdy and compact, offering industrial-grade durability and reliability, strengthening the printer’s capacity to meet the requirements you have for your creative project of business.CyFantasy LCD 3D printer allows you to monitor and modify the printing process during the printing process: from the printing time to the remaining time, you can view the data displayed on the screen at any time, and you can change to adjust the items. Real-time display through the operation panel.We’ve spent a few years looking into the challenges of 3D printing until we came to our presently successful formula. We no longer see extremely high prices for printers and consumables, and we’ve been seeing FDM technology and SLA machines and consumables becoming increasingly accessible and affordable. Still, we knew that low-cost technologies such as the new LCD sacrificed accuracy and size to generate savings for the buyer. That was not satisfactory, so we decided to develop a large-size, high-precision, low-price LCD 3D printer.It sounded great, but we hit a technical wall when we realized that 3D printing LCD moulding technology is extremely layered, namely when the moulding area becomes larger. The bond with the bottom layer is so strong that, when we separate layer by layer, model separation is problematic and may even lead to model deformation. This explains why there are so many LCD machines on the market—but none in the large-size field. We decided to solve this problem by running a lot of tests until we finally got our CyFantasy LCD 3D Printer. It now includes intelligent functions such as one-key automatic flip, one-key refuelling, and automatic feeding, and it’s tried and tested to deliver spectacular large-format results, even being in the LCD camp. In other words, problem solved! Now we need your support to manufacture this large-size industrial-grade precision 3D printer!This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 2,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $900M raised between them.",

                "Text": " Haz click aquí para ver la campaña en español. I’ve always liked buying online, for me, it’s the most comfortable and simple way to do it. I find annoying the process of going to a physical store to buy whatever I need, sadly delivery hasn’t changed or improved in the last couple of years, outside of the united states getting a package delivered can take up from a couple of weeks to months, and let's not even talk about the ridiculous fees than cant rack up to 200% of what you are trying to buy, When I lived in Bolivia I became frustrated because every time I wanted to buy my favorites item from platforms like amazon I realized that the price of the delivery surpassed the price of the product, which is ridiculous. So I did a little research and found out that these companies had a monopoly on the global market, and they didn’t give a real price to their customers. So inspired by business models like those from Airbnb and Uber I thought of a solution for international deliveries. It took me many days of researching models and many hypotheses so that my idea could work, and I came to realize that a model of the shared and collaborative economy in the world of international deliveries was the perfect one. Having that information I began the real work of trying to put everything together. I began designing the app, trying to think of all the functionalities that it could have and everything that took to make the idea of Trudego a great tool for travelers of the world. This process took me about 2 months which I spent programming what would be the start of the platform. Then I started validating my idea, asking my relatives and friends if they would like to receive their packages way faster and cheaper, they even told me they would buy much more if something like this existed, so 16 years old me decided to go and make this project a reality, 2 years later I’m launching this crowdfunding campaign to show everybody that a model like Airbnb or Uber can be applied to international deliveries.Trudego is a platform that aims to become a community of people that want their products to be delivered in hours rather than weeks or months, meanwhile, we also want to become a way for people to make money out of their travels.The concept is quite simple. Do you want to make money while traveling? have some free space in your luggage? use Trudego and make some money without doing much. We live in a world where people are constantly searching for ways to generate income, and many times our community will prefer to give money to an individual rather than a company, thus creating a sharing economy.The soul of the project is much deeper than the objective, and it’s split in half, The first from the traveler's side. The concept is that by taking a couple of other people's packages you can pay for a good part of your trip. the more you deliver the more money you earn, that way we want to make sure that many Trudego fans would be able to travel the world for free. In the second part, we side with the buyer. A person who is in some part of the world and who is buying a product online from another part of the world, it doesn’t even have to be something you bought, it could be a gift from your grandma, that she wanted to arrive on a certain date and international shipping couldn’t deliver. The idea is that the moment you make your purchase you can connect with a traveler who is in the city of purchase and who has a destination to your city, thus achieving something no intercontinental shipping can do at a decent price, getting your package in under 5 days.To summarize, our sole objective is to build a community that loves using Trudego and uses it to finance their journeys through the world. On the other hand, we got people a control panel Trudego to get their products worldwide, becoming one of the fastest shipping methods. The more people use it, the more we can change the world.Nowadays the market of international deliveries has become lazy, and companies like Trudego could move the foundations of the current market, sending a wake-up call to these companies that lost their ambition for innovation, and disrupting their ridiculous business practices.The fact that people could win money traveling is utopic and sounds fake, but with Trudego, something as simple as taking a package with you to the airport could become an opportunity to make money, is a concept that allows people to enjoy traveling more often, and with better quality of trips. One of our greatest innovations is the fact that we are going to create a tool designed for the consumer. In other words, the main problem that we solve is not that people need new sources of income, since that is only a consequence of our creation. The main problem is the time it takes to get the package and the security of that package. At Trudego we are really about your experience and wish that Trudego is your number 1 option when it comes to delivery.I am not looking for Trudego to be a small platform that competes at a minuscule level in the market. But on the contrary, a very interesting alternative to traditional shipping options.The platform has two types of functions: Trudego integrates into  Ecommerce and the sending of packages from person to person.Let's put ourselves in the place of a customer, the customer enters an online store and buys the products, then the store itself tells the customer that they use Trudego, then if the store doesn’t cover the delivery, the client pays for it through the store, and the store pays Trudego, from a customer's point of view they will only make 1 payment when the total to pay is shown, and the store will make the arrangement with Trudego, the same applies when the store offers free shipping.The client then receives a mail from Trudego that notifies him that our platform will manage the delivery, and the mail will tell the client the approximate day and time the package will be delivered, according to the store and the traveler that will be making the delivery; Once that’s done they will receive a link with the current status of the package and the route of said package. Then the agreed day the traveler will arrive at the door of the buyer with the packages.The traveler must register, filling in some important questions that will be shown to anyone on the platform, this information will help us notify the traveler of packages from stores or people,  that the traveler might like to deliver, the information of each package will be shown, information like the weight or dimensions of each package, the exact pick-up location and any photos there are; if everything is correct the traveler will make an offer and negotiate the fee and the time it will take to deliver the traveler could work with a suggested fee or they can negotiate the fee themselves. assuring the traveler that he/she can benefit from their travels. Trudego’s commission will be 15%.If the offer is accepted, a customer’s communication tab will open where the traveler and the store/ person will be able to communicate better and arrange the details of the pick-up. This communication is optional because stores can give the information beforehand to expedite the shipping process. Once everything is sorted the traveler picks up the package and travels to the destination, the day it is arranged the package will be delivered and the status of the package will be updated.To ensure the safety of the package and its safe delivery the traveler must leave a warranty and make a 2-step verification, The first step is that the travelers have some money as a warranty, and in case of the package not being delivered Trudego will cover all the damages, the next safety step is, in case the package is of high value the traveler must give and extra monetary warranty, all the money will be returned to the traveler when the package is delivered, thus giving the customer and the store and extra layer of protection against any problem, even in cases of fortuitous events, the company will cover any damage through insurance.The travelers will also have many tools at their disposal like maps and information about the packages that will help them plan their journeys. Something important to emphasize is that Trudego won’t cap the number of packages a traveler can deliver,  as long as all the safety regulations are met with their airline of preference.Let’s imagine that we want a package delivered from Barcelona to Miami, said package is a laptop that we sold through our eCommerce website, and at the moment of the purchase the customer added the shipping address, automatically a petition is generated to deliver the package, the petition is then sent to every traveler with a scheduled trip from Barcelona to Miami, a suggested price will generate automatically, and the only thing that changes is who will deliver the package, then the travelers will try to negotiate the conditions of the delivery. Trudego also offers an automatic mode that can be set according to our preferences, maybe we want the cheapest delivery, maybe we want the fastest or the traveler with the best score available, once that’s done a chat will open, giving us direct communication between us and the traveler, there we can coordinate everything, to the date and time of the pickup to more specific details that might make a better experience.The advantage Trudego offers is that if you need an express delivery you could contact someone that travels the next day, making an intercontinental delivery in just 2 days!The store could choose to only work with Trudego or offer Trudego and other traditional shipping companies. The store will have a control panel showing every order, payment, pending travelers, delivery offers, and many more tools at their disposal.So maybe two people want to use Trudego? let’s assign them, person A and person B.Person A wants to send a package from California to Paris, Person A enters Trudego and makes a new offer detailing everything about the package, this way an order is placed the many travelers available can interact with a said offer, then Person A chooses which traveler wants to work with; then Person A decides if they want to pay for the delivery or Person B could be in charge of paying, then the traveler picks the package up and, everything is set in motion, and every aspect of the process is identical to the rest.Tiers:- Raise your hand!

Since I was a little kid I was interested in all things about business. I was involved in the business. I used to put a price on things that most kids would not even consider, for example, I didn't sell you candy, in school, I sold you the thrill of eating candy in class and laughing with your friend from the little mischief.The way I was, wasn't formed naturally, it was due to the way that I was raised, many things that I considered unfair, like helping my family business while the other kids played. are the things that made me who I am today.I know I'm the right person to make this project a reality. I have the experience and the passion to do everything that's in my power to make Trudego successful entrepreneurship. I've funded Nepus, a crowdfunding advisory agency. Nepus gave me the experience I needed and made me come into contact with experienced people that have given me a lot of knowledge.",

                "Text": "…and we're even stronger than before!You may remember the Pebl from 2019? Despite not meeting our target funding goal, we were overwhelmed with the support from our original pledgers! Thank you!We wanted to show our appreciation by giving a 10% discount to be used in our Store for all previous supporters that re-pledge, if the campaign is successfully funded. This will last for a full month and can be redeemed by signing up to our Portal. Don't worry, we'll let you know when you can do that!When you boil it down,  we're just a bunch of enthusiastic nerdy guys, working long hours in a converted dentistry lab, in the southwest of England. We're trying our absolute hardest to make the IoT a place that allows anyone with an idea, no matter how big, to make a go of it and hit the ground running! Your trust in us and your generous pledges will give us the chance to make that a reality :)We're all mostly excited to see your creations and wonderful ideas, spawned from the ability to implement IoT into your project, overnight. So get that imagination flowing and read on...If you're not familiar with Pebl, you may want to skip to the \"What is a Pebl?\" section!We were being asked left, right and center if we'd be offering the Pebl for sale on our website despite not meeting our goal. Unfortunately, the answer was no as we just couldn't afford to do so :(However, immediately after our last Kickstarter campaign, we managed to secure funding which enabled us to further develop the Pebl product and supporting infrastructure to a point where it is now firing on all cylinders and waiting to be used by you!After learning so much from the last campaign, this time around, we're going to try our hardest to provide more information about HOW the Pebl can be used to enable your products to become part of the IoT!Scroll down, take a look and please get in touch if you have any questions!With the feedback we've received over the last couple of years, we have been able to improve and develop our offering further, and we now believe it is far better than before and overall, a more complete and well rounded solution.The Pebl hardware has been completely redesigned to cater for new features, better reliability and higher performance.We have redesigned the power management system to allow for a wider range of input voltages whilst consuming lower power and generating less heat. We have also optimised the WiFi antenna location to provide a longer range and better performance. A fully featured UART serial bus was squeezed in for even more flexibility. The RGB led control now has more stability, allowing improved visual performance by fixing a known flickering issue.An exciting new addition for our pledgers is an easy to use and handy Evaluation Board for the Pebl, so straight out of the box, you can get to grips with the way that it works and what it's capable of!Find out more information below and take a look at our Virtual Pebl Evaluation Board to get a taster of how it works!We have worked extremely hard to build the user front end to the point where it is now useable for everyday management and control of all your devices. This was something that was not readily available before, but is now raring to go!We're really pleased with it and hope you get an opportunity to use it! We have built in multi tenancy for our commercial users and a full account management system, which is further explained, later on.We're most proud of this achievement, being the backbone of device control and usage. The final outcome is awesome! The newly reworked API allows for no fuss usage, with no tiresome hoops to jump through, no manufacturer lockdowns and best of all, it's completely documented! All this whilst of course being fully authenticated.The Fingoti back end has full multi tenancy support allowing users to not only create multiple organisations for their devices but also for a partner/tenant relationship with customers. More about that later... At Fingoti we are striving to provide a simple, out-of-the-box gateway solution to the Internet of Things (IoT). We wanted all the research and development to be done for you and encapsulated it in a smart, secure, flexible and reliable package as standard.And so the Pebl was born.Pebl can connect with and control electrical equipment, from making sure the kettle is boiled for that first cup of coffee in the morning, to collecting analytics to track production efficiency for your business. The possibilities are endless.The IoT is a place where everyday physical items are quickly becoming part of the virtual world that is the internet. These items can be controlled and monitored from a distance to, for example, improve your life at home, increase productivity in the workplace or improve performance and reliability in industrial equipment.The IoT is already a very big and daunting place, especially if you are just starting out. Trying to manufacture and provide an IoT solution can be an expensive and drawn out process, requiring technical and specialist expertise. We believe it should be intuitive and simple, so we've done all the hard work for you. Our product can be used by everyone and anyone. Pebl provides an end-to-end solution for enthusiasts, business owners, education, home automation projects and... well, anything!The Pebl is a standalone IoT device that requires no assembly and no programming.  Following a simple two minute setup procedure, your Pebl is ready to be incorporated into your project providing IoT functionality that will bridge the gap between the virtual and physical world, from and to anywhere in the world!We really are providing the complete IoT solution.  We offer the hardware, software and back-end infrastructure,  supporting all that you will ever want to do. All you have to do is provide the power of imagination!Now that we've looked at what the Pebl is and how it works, now let us explain what it can be used for and why we think it's such an incredible little tool that unlocks so much potential...The Pebl is designed to be used as a component within custom hardware. You can think of it as a secure IoT bolt-on for your existing and exciting new projects. You can simply implement the Pebl into your project or solution by modifying existing or creating new circuitry to meet the demand of your application.We believe that by implementing the Pebl into your existing or new development project or product, you will see fast and large returns. This is due to the lack of upfront setup costs, as we provide the entire solution.Preventative maintenance, remote monitoring and assistance, data processing and management packages are all contracts that you can provide to your customers, at the price of a single device, the size of a sugar cube!Pebl is designed to remove any requirement for central control hubs, is completely self-reliant and requires almost no technical knowledge to set up. Simply download our app, enter your WiFi credentials and that's it. You are connected to the IoT and ready to begin making your own ripples in the internet.Every Pebl can be set-up wirelessly, using our USB Adapter or pre-configured at time of manufacture. Once the Pebl is configured, you can let your imagination run wild and build the next big thing, streamline your factory, teach your STEM pupils or monitor your heating from work.So why use a Pebl and not an Arduino or Raspberry Pi instead?First and foremost, security. The Pebl, unlike other similar devices on the market, comes with enterprise grade security as standard.Additionally, the Pebl is pre-programmed.  One of the challenges with the Arduino, Raspberry Pi and similar devices, is creating the code you need to achieve your application's goal. More often than not, this rarely proves easy or reliable. The Pebl simply responds to predetermined commands.Furthermore, as the Pebl is a fully encapsulated device, you don't have to worry about electrostatic discharge (ESD) or moisture damage as you would with bare board devices like the Arduino and Raspberry Pi. The watertight housing provides a barrier for use in almost any scenario, protecting against harsh environments.Four GPIO pins and a data bus for communication with I²C and UART sensors and accessories is made available. This allows makers to produce and market their own IoT peripherals that the Pebl can simply plug into. The Pebl device can be used for multiple applications by easily removing and reinserting into another product.For enthusiasts and inventors, we provide a breadboard breakout adaptor,  to enable you to easily implement a Pebl into your projects for quick and easy development and testing.We are offering a wide range of rewards that we hope will spark your imagination and get your ideas flowing!Good question. I suppose it's not much use just sitting there looking pretty!The Pebl will accept, execute and respond to a predetermined set of commands from various methods of communication. There's something for everyone here and regardless of the method you choose,  the requests and responses are identical.Please visit the Developer section of our website to learn more about and try out the Pebl commands for yourself.We designed the Pebl to be as flexible and versatile as possible so that it could be used in most environments...IndustryHobbyistEducationDomesticSecurityMarineMedicalAgricultureThe Fingoti Portal is a secure place to manage, monitor, control and interacts with your and your customer's Pebl devices.The Pebl can be used with or without our Portal. The vast majority of customers will use the Portal for its convenience and ease of use. However, the Pebl can be used in many other different ways, which of course, are free of charge, as explained previously.We've designed the Portal to cater for everyone from enthusiasts to small business owners and even large commercial applications. We have implemented our own infrastructure on the Microsoft Azure platform, resulting in a user experience that is intuitive, concise and rewarding.If you decide to use the Portal, we charge for the use of communications called 'Ripples'. A single Ripple is a full device request and response cycle. Ripple usage is either based on a pay-as-you-go or subscription basis.You'll get 1,000 free Ripples with every new account, but if you require more for your application, then you can choose to pay from just £1.00 for 5,000 additional Ripples. This essentially means you can query your device every 10 mins for an entire month, for just the price of a cheeseburger!If you are using our API as a commercial customer or as a third party developer, the charge is issued in the same manner, however, high usage of the Portal can result in a cheaper monthly contract if desired.Our payment terms are completely transparent and you can pay for as much or as little as you want to use, with or without a subscription.From our Portal, users can claim devices using just the serial number. Once the Pebl is linked to an account, the owner can monitor activity, manage settings and connect with other Pebl devices, including virtual devices.The back end infrastructure is centred around an organisation. Users can be members of multiple organisations by either creating a new one or being invited to an existing one, through a very simple email invitation process.  Every organisation has its own set of roles that can be assigned to a user, in order to grant access to certain areas. Either make use of the system roles provided or create custom roles.Your devices are then claimed by the organisation. That way, users can be added and removed without affecting the use of any device. All of this can be easily managed on our Portal or via the API.You can also apply to become a partner which gives you the ability to create organisations as tenants. This allows you to set up organisations for your customers whilst maintaining the ability to manage everything for them, from their devices to their subscriptions.Please take a look at our Usage Calculator above to get a clear idea of our pricing, should you wish to use the Portal.We're really excited about this :)We hope that you'll support us and pledge for one of these boards, as they are an excellent way to discover and explore the Pebl's capabilities and how it can easily be implemented into your application. Your pledges will also fund further Portal development and help to boost our product's market introduction.The Evaluation Board allows you to try out all the following features:Take a look for yourself...Or, if you'd rather have a play, check out the Virtual Evaluation Board we put together!Now it's even easier to set up your Pebl! You can simply use the USB Adapter to connect the Pebl to your laptop or computer and send the commands to get your credentials loaded onto the Pebl.Not only that, but the USB Adapter can be used for testing and debugging, with built in GPIO indicators for easy trouble shooting. In addition to being able to send requests and receive responses, you can also stream raw serial data across the internet using the UART bus mode!Wow! If you've got this far, you must be keen (or just really nerdy?!)There is a lot of exciting stuff packed into such a small little gadget. Here are few amazing things that the Pebl is capable of, with a bit more detail to explain...The Pebl's onboard 160MHz 32-bit processor is used in conjunction with a WiFi engine as its primary network connection method. The WiFi connection has a range of up to 50 metres.The 2.4GHz WiFi engine uses the standard 802.11 b/g/n protocol and provides an extremely reliable connection to a router or access point. WiFi connections are WPA, WPA2 and WEP compatible as standard and incorporate a variety of TKIP and AES encryption, as required.In simple terms, the Pebl's WiFi provides secure, powerful and reliable performance, resulting in a lightning fast response to user requests.The biggest risk for IoT devices is the lack of security. The Pebl provides peace of mind where this is concerned. Its WiFi is fully capable of end-to-end encryption when using our Fingoti Portal.We use Microsoft's Azure platform to provide a robust and proven method of transmitting data over the internet, securely. Using a SHA256 encrypted SAS key, communication to the Portal from the device is protected while in transit and at rest by Microsoft's firewalled servers.With the IoT world requiring clever, reliable and varied sources of power, we didn't want to limit the device to a particular voltage.  Instead, we've made the Pebl tolerant to a wide range of voltage inputs. This allows you to power the Pebl with a USB output, solar panel or even a car battery, just to name a few.With a built in voltage pump, the Pebl will operate on a wide input voltage range of anywhere between 3v and 16v. The onboard voltage smoothing ensures that the GPIO outputs aren't electrically noisy and provide a steady 5v output regardless of the input voltage. The voltage regulation does generate a small amount of heat, but this is properly dissipated, with efficient built-in heat sinking.Simply, the Pebl can be used with many different power sources, allowing a wide range of applications.The 4 user-configurable GPIO pins on the Pebl act as inputs or outputs as required in your application. They each provide an output of 5v with up to 25mA of current which is more than enough to power logic, LEDs or relays, amongst other things.These GPIO pins can detect a change in GPIO state every second, instantly reporting back the information to the user.The Pebl acts like a secure, remote middleman in serial communication, simply passing bytes onward via the bus and handling incoming data to be relayed back to the user. Making use of the serial bus, allows users to communicate with external processors and modules in two different ways...Using the Pebl's serial bus as a master for high-speed I²C data bus applications, serving over 100 slave modules is an extremely useful feature. The data bus is 5v tolerant and incorporates the necessary pull-up resistors.I²C is a globally recognised communications protocol that uses just two wires for data transfer. This allows for a vast range of sensors and devices, such as an RTC (real time clock) above, to be monitored, read and written to, from anywhere in the world.There is an abundance of I²C modules and devices on the internet at extremely low prices, that are very well documented for easy implementation.The Pebl's serial bus can also be configured to be used as a fully featured UART serial bus for your application. This is useful for applications that require external communications to GPRS or GMS modules.The UART serial mode allows the user to send and receive serial data instantaneously! All standard serial communication settings are exposed, for example, baudrate, parity and flow control, for use with many different UART applications.The Pebl includes a 16 million colour RGB LED that can be changed to any colour using a single command, visually communicating with users for many different purposes.The device also incorporates a 'blink' feature that allows you to adjust the flashing speed, duration and colour. This provides additional flexibility and uses for the Pebl device.Pretty cool, eh?Want to use the Pebl outdoors? No problem.  The device is immune to dust, dirt, rain, moisture and extreme weather. The Pebl is designed to be IP67 rated,  which certifies that it's waterproof and we're working on getting this officially assessed as soon as possible after our campaign.Ask the Pebl to do the heavy lifting for you to perform tasks automatically. Set a timer to read the temperature every hour, or turn a heater on at 5:00pm ready for when you get home from work, using the scheduler!Okay, okay, we know it doesn't have a battery,  but believe it or not, that was a conscious decision. A battery limits you to use devices and peripherals that are low powered which can limit your IoT application - not what we want to see!We believe that for an IoT device to be truly reliable and ensure that its data reporting is as accurate as can be, then it should be continuously powered. We have an environmental responsibility to provide the best performance we can, so, we made the Pebl as power efficient as possible. It consumes approximately 350mW on average.Isn't it irritating when new software gets released and you have to individually update every device you have? Not with the Pebl, it's actively checking for updates.We release software updates after passing an extensive customer acceptance testing process, so we're confident they won't interrupt your IoT application and cause any hiccups. You can opt for scheduled automatic updates when they are available or if your application is mission critical, update manually via the Fingoti Portal at a time that suits you.If your Pebl is connected to our Portal, you'll never miss an update, forever.Using the Pebl via the Fingoti Portal is easy and seamless. The Pebl can connect itself to our Portal (if you wish) which allows you to access,  monitor, change and update it using our friendly Portal user interface.But, don't worry, that's not the only way to use your Pebl...The ways in which the Pebl can communicate with the outside world are extensive.For those budding entrepreneur and/or nerds amongst you who are looking for a more commercial, industrial or custom solution or you'd consider yourself an advanced user then the Pebl will respond to other methods of communication.Our API can also be utilised for direct communication, securely, via our Portal, but implementing your own user interface and back-end. This solution can be useful for third-party developers and custom applications that require high security and minimal fuss/cost setup.Please take a look at our API Reference Documentation and Device CommandsYes, we get that a lot, it really is that small!Requirements for the size of the Pebl were defined early on to be as 'small as possible' but remaining 'beautifully tactile' - not an easy one.It was important that the Pebl was both minimal and self-contained.  This compares to the IoT hardware that is currently available, often being bare-board with exposed electrical components. Every cubic millimetre of the device has been utilised. All components are internal and self-contained with a chemical and water resistant resin, which acts as a heat sink as well as protection from environmental factors.",

                "Title": "Eclipse: Audio visualizing ferrofluid speaker",
                "Text": "The Eclipse speaker is the first of its kind ferrofluid audio visualizing Bluetooth speaker. With the power of electromagnets, the Eclipse translates your audio into magnetic pulses that push the ferrofluid creating a stunning display of real fluid animations.*The version shown is a prototype and the final version will be refined and upgraded.This is our demo video for our current working prototype of the Eclipse. Please note on the final version the LED strips will be hidden, the glass bottom will be removed and perfectly round, LED strips will be brighter, and the speaker drivers will be tuned. Additionally, the ferrofluid animation and coding are still being optimized.This is basically our rough draft speaker and as RND continues the Eclipse speaker on release will be refined and perfected.  We are still sourcing materials and parts to guarantee the Eclipse speaker has incredible build quality.Sixty-one years ago, NASA engineers created the first magnetic fluid called the ferrofluid. This invention made it the world's first truly magnetic liquid. Inspired by this feat, we formed a team and created the Eclipse speaker. The Eclipse is a first-of-its-kind speaker that uses a ferrofluid and an electromagnet to create a stunning audio visualizer.For ferrofluid to even be visible in a glass bottle, just like traditional ferrofluid containers, the glass has to be specially treated to prevent staining. The manufacturing process for a ferrofluid bottle can be time-consuming and costly to ensure the glass is properly treated.Your device > audio analyzer > electromagnet > ferrofluid movementThe Eclipse speaker works by taking audio transmitted from your device and converting that audio into digital signals. Those signals are then sent to the electromagnet where it pulses those signals as magnetic forces. The magnetic forces meet the ferrofluid causing a magnetic reaction and thus the ferrofluid movement.We've fine-tuned and refined our firmware through countless hours of testing and coding all in a pursuit to add features to prevent dead spaces, obtain the best visuals possible, and regulate the electromagnet's sensitivity. Utilizing the ferrofluids magnetic property the Eclipse’s audio is enhanced with our Fluid Mass Bass boost system.Fluid Mass Bass Boost takes advantage of the mass of the ferromagnetic fluid by exactly matching the speaker output phasing to the movement of the fluid.This results in a physical alteration to the center of mass of the speaker cabinet and allows for a more solid and realistic bass sound than would typically be achieved with a speaker of this size and specification.tl;dr the ferrofluid makes the bass sound good.Capacitive touch controls: At the top of the Eclipse is our control module for the speaker. Flat and touch-sensitive controls similar to a touch screen to control volume, Bluetooth, pause, and many more features.LED lighting: Inside the Eclipse's main chamber is LED lighting for the ferrofluid bottle. The LED is RGB+W allowing you to display just about any color imaginable including pure white. LED is controllable via our smartphone app included with your purchase.Electromagnet: Inside the Eclipse is a 500N electromagnet synced with the audio analyzer chip. Music sent to the Eclipse is converted into electromagnetic pulses rhythmically moving the ferrofluid.Removable panel: On the bottom of the Eclipse is a removable panel for swapping out ferrofluid bottles. We plan on offering additional ferrofluid colors in identical glass bottles you can switch into your eclipse.Bluetooth: No wires needed the Eclipse is 100% Bluetooth allowing you to play your music wirelessly.Fluid Mass Bass Boost: Upgrade your bass with the power of ferrofluid. Our custom-designed system utilizes ferrofluid unlike any other speaker to create a sensational bass quality.Speaker Colorway stretch goals: With a variety of colorways; you can choose a speaker that is truly yours.Front panel customization: The ellipse also has a removable front panel creating opportunities for different colors and possible artists collaborations for the most personal product possible.Colored ferrofluid stretch goal: By achieving the colored ferrofluid stretch goal we can deliver a fairly wide range of colored fluid for greater product personalization.Style is personal and the Eclipse speaker was created with the purpose to give users a better way to express themselves and create memorable experiences. Our mission is to make the Eclipse's customization seemingly endless leaving nearly nothing to be unattainable. Lighting settings: Adjust your LED lighting with full-spectrum controls to change the color and brightness.  Plus, there are tons of color-changing lighting modes for you to choose from.Genre selector: Optimize ferrofluid animation by matching your music with a genre. Our presets are custom made to enhance ferrofluid animation for the specific genre.Sound equalizer: Customize your audio to your liking with our built-in sound equalizer. Take control of your settings and fine-tune your audio down to the finest details. Animation presets: Experiment with your ferrofluid's movement with our animation presets. Preset animation modes that change how your music is translated to ferrofluid movement. Ferrofluid control: Control your ferrofluid with no audio required from the power of your smart device. In-app controls for you to activate the electromagnet and move the ferrofluid.…And plenty of bonus features!Located at the top of the Eclipse speaker is the capacitive touch control panel. Capacitive controls are like touchscreens where you don't have to click a button to use a feature. Simply tap the icons and you can use any of the features on the panel. Features currently include volume up, volume down, Bluetooth, and power on/off.The capacitive controls are easy to use without having to worry about analog buttons breaking down or getting stuck.We didn't just stop at making a ferrofluid visualizing speaker, we made sure it sounds phenomenal too.With a max volume output of 86db, the eclipse can get as loud as a lawnmower (90db) or a vacuum (80db) at peak volume. With dual premium speaker drivers tuned to perfection, an acoustically engineered casing, and our custom Fluid Mass Bass Boost system, we can promise you the audio quality is out of this world.Designing a ferrofluid speaker isn't really something that has been done before. Unlike conventional speakers, we have numerous extra bells and whistles that need to fit inside. Not only do we have an electromagnet on the inside but speakers drivers are naturally magnetic. Forcing us to get creative and keep the ferrofluid from being drawn in by the drivers. Coding the firmware for the speaker was the next obstacle to overcome. Translating audio to magnetic pulses was another obstacle in the pursuit of perfection building this beautiful machine. We were able to generate code that synchronized pulses whenever audio hit a certain volume threshold. Then we had to refine our code to adjust for pauses in music and varying levels of volume. We didn't stop there and continued coding to make sure any song could be visualized perfectly.The code listens to and samples the music many times per second and isolates peaks in the audio at different frequencies. Then, using a self-optimizing logic, it decides which frequencies will then trigger the electromagnet.In a nutshell, our code sets a threshold for each frequency band from the audio playing. These thresholds automatically adjust and modify pulses for the audio being played. Once a threshold is broken that triggers a pulse from the electromagnet. The hold time for the pulse is determined by the audio playing.  Hold time is the length of the magnetic pulse or how long the magnet is actively holding the ferrofluid.The settings are also adjustable and customizable inside of the Apollo Eclipse app.After tons of testing and prototyping, we finally settled on a design that met our strict standards of quality and runs effortlessly.Power type: Wired (Due to the electromagnet power requirements this is NOT a portable speaker)Weight: TBD (We are still finalizing inside components)# of speakers: 2x speaker driversConnectivity Tech: Bluetooth & WIFI Electromagnet strength: 500N Front panel material: Acoustic fabric  Controls: Capacitive touch controls LEDs: RGB+W LED strips with Bluetooth connectivity for control via Apollo app  (all spectrum colors and full white)Ferrofluid bottle: 250ml anti-stain solution and 20ml ferrofluid Since its inception, a combined amount of well over 2,000+ man-hours have been put into this project. Our team has been responsible for designing, prototyping, engineering, sourcing, and funding the project. This isn't our first rodeo in the eCommerce and product development space. Our small executive has a track record of developing eCommerce brands into 7-figure giants in as little as a year. Our proven strategies for digital marketing, product dev, social media, and customer support enable us to turn customers into super fans.  With over $3,000,000 in revenue and over 200,000,000+ organic social media views to show.We've found it's much easier to sell to existing customers so our secret sauce is to create the best possible customer experience.  Fast and accurate shipping times with quality so good you rarely need customer support. We don't need any business secrets to scale just simple customer satisfaction.The Eclipse is more than just a Kickstarter for us; we're looking to turn this into a community of Apollo fanatics. We've learned a lot from developing the Eclipse and have tons of ideas stored in the bank for our product roadmap.  We can promise you there are even bigger projects to come from the Apollo team. As well as biweekly updates we will additionally be making frequent posts on our social media platforms to keep our community updated. Posts will include prototype photos, manufacturing updates, concepts, and tons of other content. Additionally, our team of customer support agents will be replying to comments and questions on Kickstarter and social media. As well as updating our FAQ page and Kickstarter with relevant information regarding the Eclipse.We're committed to staying transparent with our process and allowing customers to be informed about their products.    Pledges may vary (these are the items included in the 1st tier pledge)",

                "Text": "After successfully launching State Of The Loop in 2018, I am excited to present you my new creation, a more flexible and powerful MIDI controller. ➜ HARDWARE DESIGN :As a successor to State Of The Loop, I wanted to create a controller with a brighter and clearer display, that could properly show Looper names, Scene names, Arrangement Markers names, and more. I also wanted that the user could decide how many foot pedals he could use. Sometimes 5 is too much, sometimes 2 is not enough. After making the first prototypes, I found it so cool and useful, that I decided to make a version that could be controlled by pressing buttons instead of pedals.So open·control was born.➜ SOFTWARE DESIGN :After designing the hardware, I had to choose which actions each control should perform. But again,  it was hard to decide which functions would benefit the majority of users.  So I decided to let the user decide what's best for him as easily as possible.Right now open·control is optimized for Ableton Live, with its own Script and Editor.But being Open Source, it could evolve and encompass software like Logic, Bitwig, who knows ?The Pocket version has 6 Buttons with visual feedback and 2 Endless Knobs with Push buttons, bringing it to a total of 8 buttons. It comes in the most simple yet elegant form of a printed circuit. It is the perfect companion to your mouse and keyboard to control Live and provides easy shortcuts to your favorite actions. A 3D printed cover is available if you want to protect it.With its 8 Jack inputs, the Boxed version allows to plug up to 6 Foot Switches and 2 Expression Pedals. But if you only need half, that's not a problem, you will still enjoy its bright display and solid built. If none of the models above suit you, and you have the skills for it, you can always build your own enclosure. The Maker version has all the features of its brothers (6 buttons with visual feedback, 2 \"sliders\" and 2 endless encoders with push buttons), it is up to you to imagine the best box for your own use.open·control is fully customizable through an easy to use Web interface (also available offline).You can decide what each button will perform (long and short press), and what the  LEDs and main Display will show.Here is a list of some of the actions already available (the list will grow with User Requests) : You can also use the buttons to do \"standard\" MIDI mapping. Recently added actions : Here are a few examples of possible set ups :You can find more details on the open·control website opencontrol.me, or see the Web editor for yourself.Of course, open·control, like its predecessor, is capable of controlling Live's Looper, except that it is now much easier: Watch a little demo of open·control :In order to make it ready for the stage, and not be limited to the USB cable length, open·control has mini-jack MIDI In and Out ports. The USB cable will then only be used to provide power to the unit.  open·control can also be controled by your favorite Pedal or Pad controller (for instance Behringer's FCB1010, Roland's SPD-SX, KMI's Softstep,...). If you have a controller with MIDI Out that can send temporary CC or Note messages, just plug it in and let open·control know which Note/CC to listen to.A 3D-printed cover is available for the Pocket version.It was designed by Bruno Tognin and is made out of recycled plastic bottles. Display:     • Bright 6x32 LED Matrix     • 6 RGB LEDs both have adjustable brightness  Inputs / Outputs:     • 6 Switches (Buttons or Pedals)     • 2 Sliders (Knobs or Faders)      • Mini-Jack  MIDI In and Out       • USBopen·control is based on a Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040) chip.  It is programmed in C/C++ using Arduino, but can be programmed in CircuitPython / MicroPython.Each of the components (LEDs, buttons, matrix, Analog Inputs) can be accessed through the I/O pins.open·control already has a long story, at least in the lab...Watch it evolve from a Teensy-based \"State Of The Loop Mk2\" to a fully original and integrated device.The box itself has mutated from the first prototype of \"KBD Multifootswitch\" to the final enclosure.You can also be part of this story by supporting open·control !",

Placing items on the ground leaves the item at risk for dirt, debris, insect infestations, etc. which can be especially unfortunate when it comes to food deliveries.FreshLedge is delivery shelf system capable of being placed near a front door or window on a home, office, or other building. The system is comprised of a shelf with a hinged mechanism near its rear edge used to firmly secure the shelf to the building exterior. The hinge allows the shelf to be placed in a vertical position for storage when not in use and a horizontal, deployed position when a package is ready to be received.Delivery personnel can pull down the shelf when he or she is delivering a box or other package to a building. The shelf accommodates the item(s) and keeps them elevated, safe from dirt, debris, insects, etc. There can be extensions or attachments to support different sizes of items ranging from boxes, beverage containers, food containers, and more. Optional smart home features could also be integrated in which the shelf can automatically deploy to a specific length when a package delivery is nearby.The system can be constructed using metal, plastic, and other suitable materials. The shelf and other components may feature custom colors or designs to accommodate all user needs and preferences. Exact size, measurement, construction, and design specifications may vary upon further development and manufacturing. I currently hold a provisional patent on \"FreshLedge\" and will obtain a non-provisional patent by early next year.Here is my current prototype at my home. I made it out of wood, hinges, magnets and chains. We use ours by noting it in the comment section of our deliveries. For example: We order fresh baked cookies to take to work sometimes and they deliver them fresh as soon as 8am in the morning. When we place the order the night before on the app, we note in the comments, \"Please do not place on floor, please pull down FreshLedge on wall by front door and place there, thank you.\"What has happened in the past is,  they place the box on the floor and leave (contactless delivery) and we don't notice the \"delivered\" notification on the app, since we are either in the shower or getting ready. By the time we notice, even if it's just a few minutes after, a trail of ants has made its way into the box and you know the rest lol. The future of  FreshLedge could be very cool, ESPECIALLY when it becomes a SmartLedge and can be something that could be a touchscreen/camera/doorbell/ledge all in one. Pretty much your own concierge, it even holds your bags. Thank you for taking the time to read about my idea, have an amazing life and continue to be great!",

EBM integrates hardware and software methods to monitor honeybee (Apis Mellifera) colonies with various sensors in and around the hive. We're enhancing EBM with AI.Why EBM? Because the bees are dying and the climate is changing, and EBM provides continuous monitoring of bee colonies without invasive hive inspections that disrupt natural bee cycles. EBM also supports environment/climate studies, because the behavior and health of bee colonies tell us a great deal about the environment and the climate.BeePi is an open design EBM platform we've been developing since 2014. BeePi is unique, because it 1) does video analysis to measure bee traffic in the vicinity of a hive and to generate hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly traffic graphs; 2) does ambient audio analysis to separate bee buzzing from noise and to correlate ambient audio with traffic and weather data; 3) respects the sacredness of bee space -- no sensors are placed on the bee or inside the hive.Our goals for Stage 3 are: 1) to port all our video/audio algorithms to the raspberry pi platform so that all data processing is done on a single pi with zero computation/storage in the cloud; 2) to continue and enhance the curation of large video, image, audio, and weather datasets from over half a terrabyte of raw data accumulated in Stages 1 and 2 of the BeePi Project; 3) to make BeePi hardware and software available to researchers, practitioners, citizen scientists, and enthusiasts through project rewards in order to make BeePi  a global EBM platform.If you're not a techie, there are rewards for you to show your passion for pollinator health/sustainability/Open Science with limited edition seed packages, cool bumper stickers, and slick T-shirts.By backing BeePi you support Open Science -- the practice of science that aims to increase transparency and impact of scientific research beyond the peer reviewed article. Open scientists engage communities worldwide in grassroots collaboration and discussion of scientific research through direct participation.Don't confuse Open Science with Open Source (free software).

                "Title": "Lying Down Desk",
                "Text": "I have chronic back issues and have dreamed of lying down while using a computer for years. Yet the only option I could find to buy cost a few grand. Last year, I designed my own, got a prototype made, and have been using it for six months. Now, I want others to be able to have a Lying Down Desk too.I've had problems with my back since I was a teenager, which included surgery. Thankfully, I am still quite physically able, but sitting or standing for more than a short period of time are a big problem for me. I can run, climb, do backflips, etc, but chairs are painful.For years I've been trying to find a way to use a computer lying down, yet all I could find that already existed were some expensive models based on reclining dentist chairs with extendable apertures.Then, I had an idea: put a monitor under a table, facing the floor. It's simple, but I couldn't find it already done or available online. I tried it out using my tablet, a cardboard box with a hole in it, and a couple of chairs:I sketched a design for a desk, asked a friend to make it, and have been using it for half a year. It’s been as good as I imagined it might be, and I’m in much less pain than before. And I’ve only come close to falling asleep in a meeting once!Now, I want to make it available to as many people as possible, and thought Kickstarter would be the best way to get the first set of orders. The Lying Down Desk is primarily aimed at anyone with physical impairments which affect sitting, such as upper and lower back issues. That said, I suspect there will also be a few unimpaired chair users who would also find lying down more comfortable.Most tables are about 80cm high, so to get the monitor to be at the right height, there is a hole in the table and a shelf-like unit placed on top of a table which has the monitor installed beneath it. This top unit allows the monitor to be about 95cm from the floor so that it is about 75cm from the user’s eyes. The user has a keyboard either on their lap or on the floor, my recommendation is a split keyboard with half on either side of the hips on the floor. This does mean that the user has to be able to type without seeing the keyboard – or they have to set up a periscope or video feed to see their hands!I do not yet have a finalised design with an agreed person to make it -- I am in discussions with a couple of potential makers. So you will receive a desk which matches the design specification, but will probably be a different colour, style, etc, than the CAD image or my prototype.If you see this and think \"oh, I'll just make my own\" -- well that's great, and I'm going to make a PDF document with design, guide to making it, accessories, etc. My main aim is to get desks into the world, not be filthy rich. With the PDF, you can DIY or hire someone to make it bespoke for you.I do have a patent pending on this design, so it would be an infringement for someone else to make and sell this design at a profit. 1 licence would come with the PDF so that someone can lawfully make it for you. If you are someone who makes desks and you want to make and sell the Lying Down Desk, please get in touch and we can explore working together!I already have a finished design and a complete prototype, so am ready to go to potential makers to get quotes and discuss designs, materials and timelines.  Timeline: I've planned for three months to find and finalise a manufacturer(s), three months for manufacture and delivery, and three months safety time.If it turns out that the tables cost less to make than I am budgeting for, then I will use the surplus to give away some desks for free to people who couldn't afford to buy one.With the Desk will come a PDF that includes:Typing is obviously a big deal for using a computer. You have to be able to generally type without looking to use it while lying down. If you can already do this, then it will just take a couple of days to get used to it. The only problem is when you first lie down, or when you move your hand between mouse and keyboard, you have to find your place again. Most of the time it's alright, but sometimes I hit the wrong key and have to figure out where my fingers are and re-place them. It's pretty alright though -- maybe sometime I will do a demo video showing me typing and swapping in realtime!Each desk will be adjusted to the height of the user for the standing surface.  A standing desk surface should be at or just below elbow height, so that the elbow is at 90-95 degrees.  After the Kickstarter is completed, I will contact backers to get everyone's details. You can either measure your elbow height yourself or plug your height into this size guide for an estimate: https://www.ergotron.com/tools/workspace-plannerIf this Kickstarter gets completed, then I'll be really happy that I designed something that other people use!Hopefully, I will also continue to make and sell more Lying Down Desks and set up as a small business. This initial set of orders will allow me to establish a relationship with one or more cabinet makers who can continue to make them as orders come in. If it goes well, I will also expand to be able to sell just the top unit, so that someone can use a desk they already have or buy a second-hand one, and the 2-in-1 Model, which is just for standing and lying, which I expect some people might want because it takes up less space and they already have a table. If it goes well, I'll incorporate as a B Corporation, a type of social enterprise which is about positive social impact and not just profit. I care about disability justice and will be glad to make a project that can help people be in less pain. Anything we do to reduce chronic pain, impairments and disabilities and make people's lives better is a win.I care about poverty and economic inequality, and do not like the fact that in our current economic system, people without money have to go without. Nobody should live without their basic needs being met, and if that means needing a Lying Down Desk to be able to use a computer, then these should be available! I will make sure that some Lying Down Desks will be available for free for people or organisations who cannot afford them.I care about the natural world. As well as political efforts I am involved in to reduce ecological destruction caused by human activity, when making desks I will investigate how this can be done with as little ecological impact as possible. This will include either reclaimed wood or sustainably sourced wood, and in the future I might also look into using existing or second-hand tables. FAQs- What exactly will it look like? Don't know exactly. It will be the same 3-in-1 design as shown in the CAD images and photos of the prototype, but it may be a different colour, have different legs, etc. If there are colour choices, I will ask everyone for their preferred colour. - I can just make it myself? Quite! I support this, I like the idea of people making something I designed or modifying the design. If you want to just copy it, nothing stopping you and I don't mind. To make it easy for you, I've prepared a PDF which has drawings of the design, a guide for making it, and a list of all the accessories, and my tips on using the desk, which I think is fair to sell for a small amount.- What else would I need? As well as the desk (and a computer!), you would need a monitor to have in the desk and a keyboard and mouse to use while below the desk. If people want, I can buy those in bulk and bundle them together with delivery of the desk to save you the effort (which everyone would have to pay for!).If you are going to swap between lying and standing/sitting a lot, I would recommend having a keyboard and mouse set that stays on the floor, and a keyboard and mouse set that stays on top of the desk. That way you don't have to keep picking and moving a keyboard and mouse! I have the split keyboard on the floor and an easy bluetooth keyboard on top of the desk.- Bit expensive? I think it's a fair price. It's a higher price than a standard desk because it is two components, almost like a shelf or coffee table on top of a regular desk. The price is comparable to an electric motor desk that swaps between sitting and standing.  That being said, I would love for there to be a cheaper version in the future.- I'm not in GB? Get the PDF Design download to either make it yourself (either DIY or take the design to someone to make it bespoke). Or if enough people are interested, then we could try finding someone who would make a set of them to make it easier. - What about accessories etc? Buy: monitor plus keyboard, these may be a bundle if people want it to see if we can get them cheaper. Additional things, USB extenders, mouse, etc, I have suggestions which will be in the PDF.- Won't it look a bit weird in the office? lol.- What about using a webcam? If you're happy to be on video lying down, then you could get a webcam to use face-down by the monitor. - What's in the PDF? The PDF which comes with the desk includes: a full list of accessories, eg keyboard, mouse, cables and tips about how to use the desk. The DIY PDF Download also includes design images and a guide for how to make it.- The 2-in-1 Lying/Standing Design? This isn't available at the moment, though in the future I hope to be able to sell it. However it is included in the DIY PDF Download if you want to make it yourself!- how is the monitor attached? Using a standard mount. They are pretty solid and you can always give it a tug and a wiggle to check it is solid.",

                "Text": "It's no secret that women spend hours doing their hair. Washing, brushing, styling, and hopefully maintaining their hair, just to do it over again. The cycle of rinse and repeat. The Roll&Glow will cut the time it takes to style your hair and give you the ability to move around while your hair is getting styled. Almost every time you do your hair you have to stand or sit in one area for a long period of time. With the Roll&Glow that will be the problem of yesterday. Everyone wants an easier way to style their hair with minimal hassle, the Roll&Glow does that. I've watched countless videos of women doing their hair and I know this would benefit all of us. My own experience as a child and my mother doing my hair, or even as an adult dealing with my natural hair sparked my interest in improving the tools we were given. I want women and children around the world to enjoy doing their hair. Meet the Rollers The funding will go into assembling prototypes. The mechanical and electrical engineers focusing on the wireless aspect of the Roll&Glow. They will be looking for the best material to make it lightweight so it doesn't weigh down on you and a way to create it with minimal noise. The rollers will distribute room temperature air, so you don't have to worry about your hair getting caught on fire. There will also be a screen/fan guard in the middle to prevent your hair from getting caught in the fan. There will be different size rollers, so the styles you can create are limitless.The rollers will focus on the section of the, hair unlike the hooded and handheld dryers, while working from the inside and pushing out air, giving you the assurance that the inside part will be dry, so the style can come out how it was meant to be. With your support, we can make this a reality improving the hair process one head at a time.                       It can all be so simple, just Roll&Glow! Meet the creator I was born in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, I came to the states with my mother and brother when I was 6 years old in the year 2004. Back at home, my hair experience was something out of a horror movie, and it didn't help that God made me tender-headed. I still remember the first perm I got, I think I was four years old, and everyone in the compound came to see me cry out my eyes while I was getting my hair done. My mother will tell you she hated doing my hair because I would fight and fuss and she just didn't have time for that. The perm was used to help \"manage\" my hair and make it easier. The road to false beauty was paved by perms, and my mother and I fell victim to it. The perm didn't help my tender-headedness but it made my hair straight and society loved that. Fast-forward to spring break of 2015 one of my friends convinced me to go natural and I declined several times until I gave in and said \"why not\". This was the best decision of my life not only did it connect me to other young black women it connected me back to my roots! That same day, I did my big chop I convinced my mother and little sister, who had no say, to chop their hair off also. I've been natural ever since with my ups and downs and I have learned a lot. My experience has led me to where I am now with the Roll&Glow. I see how things can be improved. I want to take on the challenges of making those changes. Hair is a big way that a lot of people express themselves and with a handy tool and the right products we can create endless styles. ",

                "Title": "SciLynk: A New Era for Science",
                "Text": "“The hardest problems of pure and applied science can only be solved by the open collaboration of the worldwide scientific community.” (Kenneth G. Wilson, Nobel Laureate in Physics). Dr. Wilson was without a doubt on to something. However, even with the creation of the internet, a global collaborative research community has never been created before. Sure, there are online databases of scientists and papers out there, but there’s no global vibrant community for ALL science-lovers to communicate, interact and share research.And that’s where SciLynk comes in - it is YOUR complete science academia, whether you’re a student, professor, scientist, or casual science enthusiast. We believe by building a bridge between industry professionals and prospective future researchers, we can create a bright future for the world of science. If you are a student seeking to connect with industry professionals, SciLynk can do it. If you are a researcher looking to track research metrics and papers, SciLynk can do it. SciLynk can truly do it all - and we are extremely proud that our network was built meticulously around the feedback of dozens of researchers and students. The feedback we have gotten from them has taken months to develop, and finally, create the best possible platform tailored to their needs. We sincerely hope you can join us in this journey of building the most extensive science network out there!Our goal is to create an open-access network where the physical barriers of institutions no longer separate the most brilliant minds in the world. Imagine a world where the research departments of Stanford, Harvard, MIT, Oxford, and more, are all connected; where they can share research and find the discoveries of tomorrow. Where students worldwide can share their ideas, ask questions, and further their scientific knowledge.Not just a network, but a hub that embodies the purest values of research, collaboration, education, and connection.Imagine John, a curious student looking to get involved with the world of science. He goes to a massive site full of researchers and papers. He tries to create an account, only to see that he cannot access the network without being affiliated with a research institution. He is unable to verify that he is a researcher, and isn’t even able to access the site content - all because he was just a student ☹️Luckily for John, Scilynk, unlike other science networks, won’t be restricted by your level of education or research. We believe the best way to spark students’ interest is through interactions with professionals in their fields. Everyone should be able to access open research papers, and viewing research profiles shouldn’t be disallowed just because you are not a Ph.D.Open research means EVERYONE should be able to read and learn from papers, not just researchers, which unfortunately isn’t implemented today. SciLynk will fix that through our free-to-use science platform.One of our personal favorite features on the site is the gamification system. It combines an element of fun with profound research and collaboration and has been custom-developed using feedback from scientists and professors. In essence, the system uses a well thought-out list of triggers to award different types of points, scores, badges, ranks, and more! The system counts several different points, points for legitimate research and indices for industry professionals, and credits for STEM beginners using the site and collaborating with one another. Points can be used to buy perks and badges on the site. We believe that combining our science platform with a gamification system will allow our users to legitimately enjoy using our site, versus it being a dull hub of articles!Although we want this platform to be available to everyone, we want to ensure our researchers have the best user experience possible on SciLynk. After surveying several professors and scientists, we noticed an overall trend about their dissatisfaction with research tracking methods. Large databases use aggressive web scraping and often upload duplicate papers, wrong citation counts, and sometimes even upload the wrong paper to the wrong author. When we asked one of these researchers how many papers they’ve published, they gave us a number in the low 100s. However, their ResearchGate and Google Scholar profiles yielded 400-500 more results. That’s pretty damn inaccurate!How can we possibly fix a problem that companies as large as Google aren’t able to fix? The answer lies in using non-commercial databases that do not profit from the data they collect and use more accurate tracking methods. SciLynk plans to change this - Cambia, the creator of Lens.org, our official Partner, is one of the world’s largest and most accurate scholarly databases!Remember our good friend John? Now that he’s gotten a bit more familiarized with the science community, he thinks it's time to level up his game - internship time! Finding a lab internship wasn’t as easy as he thought.  It meant scouring the internet for contact information and applications, sending hundreds of emails, and then hoping for a couple of replies. Not efficient.With SciLynk, these prehistoric methods are going to be a thing of the past. With simple searches and mutual connections, you will be able to quickly contact professors and researchers and send over your information/resume after introducing yourself! Almost all your relevant information will already be saved to your profile, so you don’t need to worry about copy-pasting and editing dozens of messages to different people.SciLynk is built off the uber-important human medium: Connection. Online networking has shown tremendous potential, and with that, we have innovated, thought, and put countless hours into the development of our features. On SciLynk, users will be able to join domain-specific groups, ask and answer questions with our advanced discussion forums, share research papers and track important research metrics, message individuals, and/or participate in group threads, view their activity feeds to see the content that matters to them, and so much more! In addition, we already have plans for podcasts, workspaces, and in a sense, anything the community wants. Science lovers should have a platform where the possibility for collaborative scientific discovery and exploration is customizable and unique.With SciLynk, connecting is as simple as a click:We hope to enable meaningful connections between students and researchers to expand their knowledge, and researchers can pass down their knowledge. We also hope to see researchers worldwide collaborating to further progress in science and students working together with others, creating long-lasting bonds.SciLynk features several science-specific groups and subgroups known as IntraLynks, in which users can join and share updates, media, documents, and more. Users can also create groups, which act as communities of their own with several components to help users communicate with one another!SciLynk also features discussion forums, where users can ask, answer, subscribe to, save, and create meaningful discussions. This system features a nested reply system to organize answers and help users individually reply to specific topics. SciLynk’s forums are a great way for users to effectively support each other, whether it is a topic you are struggling to learn in college or an advanced research question pertaining to a paper.SciLynk was co-founded by high-school students Arnav Chakravarthy & Arvind Kumar. Two close friends and science enthusiasts, both co-founders are driven to scale SciLynk to be the standard of open research and the go-to platform for anything science. We (Arnav and Arvind) have worked with several researchers and students to get the platform to where it is today, and give our heartfelt thanks to everyone who was with us for the journey.Arnav, the CEO, is a 15 year old sophomore at Homestead High School. He wants to pursue a career in Biotechnology/Bioengineering and loves reading about general Biology and Chemistry. He manages all aspects of the company, specifically the development and outreach. He spends his free time reading, developing, playing basketball, and watching too much TV. Arnav also happens to be the much cooler co-founder ;)Arvind, the COO, is a 16 year old Junior at Lynbrook High School. He honestly doesn’t know what he wants to do yet, but he knows it will pertain to tech and medicine or law. He loves playing soccer and reading science fiction books, his favorite being ender's game. He manages the business side of SciLynk including, revenue management, advertising, partnerships, and general operations.",

                "Title": "The Web Wallet",
                "Text": "Hi, I'm Craig and welcome to my Kickstarter! This is the official launch of my new company - Tessellation Studio - and my first product - the Web Wallet.My profession and my passion is additive manufacturing - you might know it as 3D printing. Currently I am a professor teaching additive manufacturing to the next generation of engineers. My students frequently express interest in starting their own companies and launching their products through Kickstarter. As much as I wanted to help, I didn't have the experience to guide them. So I decided I would run a Kickstarter myself so I could learn the process and pass on the knowledge I gained along the way. How did I come up with the Web Wallet? Well, quite simply, I wanted to put an additively manufactured product in everyone's pocket. What better way to do that than to create a stylish, one-of-a-kind wallet that everyone wants in their pocket? In the manufacturing world we talk about \"form, fit, and function.\" Throughout most of my career I have focused on function - performance is king, especially in the aerospace world (and rightly so). For my product, however, I wanted \"form\" to be front and center. First and foremost, it had to be visually appealing. I spent a few months sketching my idea on paper, erasing it, re-sketching, erasing again, and on and on until I landed on the design that a) appealed to my asthetic and b) was both additively manufacturable and economically viable. Meeting both requirements was more challenging than I thought it would be. The result is the Web Wallet.I then had to turn my pencil sketch into a 3D model using computer aided design software. Next, I had to turn my model into a solid titanium part using a metal powder 3D printer. Of course that was just one piece of the wallet - I also had to design the two carbon fiber parts that hold the cards, the clip that provides tension and the pieces that fasten it all together.Additive manufacturing was born out of the world of prototyping. So I prototyped my initial design and pieced together an 80% solution with machined aerospace-grade carbon fiber, off-the-shelf high-strength steel fasteners, and spring steel. The result is shown in the video below. The wallet holds about four credit cards, one driver's license or ID card, and one insurance card. This was designed around how much I typically carry in my wallet. You can carry less, though you need about 4 cards minimum to hold tension on the spring. You cannot put more than about 6 cards in the wallet, as there is a set distance between the front titanium piece and the back carbon fiber piece. There is still some engineering to do for the final production item - a few modifications to the carbon fiber pieces, custom steel fasteners for the front, and a few other minor design tweaks. The prototype is good - the final design will be even better.I have tested some finishing options like iso-polishing and anodized tinting. Some people prefer the as-printed finish that clearly shows the layer lines. Others like the polished or tinted options where the layer lines are smoothed out.  And because we are using 3D printing, we can do fun things like customize the front panel with your name, initials, or other design of your choosing.The Web Wallet is only the beginning. I have other high-end consumer products in the works that will follow. The proceeds from this Kickstarter will help establish my business and grow my product line. In addition to carrying around the Web Wallet, you can wear our company swag to show your support. Check us out on tessellation-studio.com and follow us on Twitter so you are kept up to date on new product offerings.Oh, and in case you were wondering, the standard 3D printing computer file is  \".stl\" - which stands for standard tessellation language. A solid model is converted into an .stl file by covering the surface of the object with a tessellation of triangles. Hence the name and the logo. And now you know!",

The story begins with my strong desire to establish a secure society for everyone where we don’t have to worry about our business, property, and family all the time. A lot of negative thoughts come up every day because we live in a society and age where we don’t feel protected. Therefore, I feel the necessity to take security services for my son and family if they’re traveling somewhere. But then a thought crosses my mind that this issue is not limited to a single house and as I have a family, I can sense the pain a person experiences if something happens to his/her loved ones. That was the moment when I decided to provide people with an easily accessible security guard app so that not only big corporations but every common individual can get security services whenever they need them for a very reasonable and fair price.“Saba, Lead Designer of Securmo“Hey, I‘m Saba!

For over a year it was merely a dreamy \"what if\" conversation amongst friends that gained enough traction and support for me to go all in. I've spent the last several months writing requirements, interviewing development teams, and finalizing the design of an app that I cannot wait to give back to the essential oil community. It's a beautiful thing when two worlds collide. Save all of your favorite blends and recipes in a single place. No more scrolling through screenshots, searching Pinterest boards, or digging through post-it notes stashed in a drawer.Bottled & Blended allows you to create a recipe box with your favorite blends by capturing photos, sources, ingredients, and notes for every recipe that supports you and your family. We want to make it quick and easy to find the blend you're looking for. Robust search options not only allow you to search and filter by ingredients and categories, but also by keywords within your custom notes section. Your recipes are YOURS to save and share. We only surface search results for recipes you have created or saved into your own box, ensuring you have the freedom to notate exactly what each blend supports, uncensored.Think of this as your family recipe box handed down from generation to generation.Arguably the most important feature of the app for us is the ability to share. The foundation of the natural wellness community is the passion to share experience and knowledge. How many times have you been asked \"what oils do you use for this?\" or \"what was that amazing blend you were telling me about for that?\" We've designed this app so that you can quickly share your blends and recipes with anyone - even if they do not have the app - via standard text, email, and copy/paste functionality. We also make it seamless for the recipient to save recipes that are shared with them directly into their own app for future reference. Click on any oil or ingredient within a recipe to add it to your wishlist. Pull up your list when shopping so you never forget an oil again.When you grab that missing oil add it to your inventory with a single tap so you know what you've already purchased and have on hand. We mean it when we say we couldn't make this app a reality without you and we want to thank you for your generosity and belief in our dream.We worked hard to create rewards that would maximize funds raised while giving back to this amazing community. I'd be lying if I said I didn't have an absolute blast working on these designs and hope you love them as much as I do.Rewards will be fulfilled as soon as our project is fully funded. We accounted for unknown shipping delays in our delivery estimate, but plan to deliver as soon as we possibly can!Be sure to follow us on Instagram as we have lots of surprises and giveaways up our sleeves to thank you for sharing our story. We really couldn't do this without you!",

Loved the summer vibe?Can you imagine taking part of that feeling to your home bath?We created the almost perfect solution for it.AdriBatHic bath salts with local ingredient aromas with origin in 4 different flavours with a limited edition series of sea-fennel, a remarkable plant that is incredible to your skin.Salt is collected in the most northern salt pans in Mediterranean, inside a natural proteced reserve Natura 2000 park Seča Salina with 700 years of salt collecting tradition.The Sečovlje salt pans are the northernmost still functioning salt pans in the Mediterranean area and one of the few salt pans in the world where salt is produced after several centuries-old processes originating from at least the 14th century. Their speciality is that the salt pan workers cultivate petola at the bottom of the crystallization ponds. This is a biosediment which prevents the sea mud merging with the salt and gives the salt numerous microelements and minerals necessary for the human organism. It is cultivated completely through natural crystallization using their bare hands, and the tools and procedures of their ancestors. We use a mix of Salt and Salt flower that is enriched with selected unique local ingredients: olive oil, honey and aromas as sea fennel, lavander, citruses and more. We ad some sparkles with use of sodium.Shubatsu, a cleansing ritual performed by sprinkling salt, is an integral part of the Shinto religion. A significant and visible form of this ritual is when sumo wrestlers sprinkle salt around the fighting ring before a match, to purify the area.All the ingredients are mixed for a prefect balance of enjoyment, enriched with selected music playlists available in the app. Tender to your skin, soothing to your mind, fulfilling for your senses. You can memorize the feelings in memories in your mindfulness journal.Production is environment friendly with respect for tradition and latest science learnings. Packaging is sustainable - paper bags made of residual olive mass, fully recyclabe and FSC certified.This is also an excellent gift or an opportunity to enrich your store.

                "Text": "Unlike other tech manufacturers that put out wireless earbuds as just another product, we at Peacock Audio have dedicated ourselves only to the business of professional Hi-Fi earphones. We don’t make portable batteries or smartwatches. Just amazing sounding audio products. This dedication and experience have allowed us to explore the depths of driver technologies that allow the most efficient and resonant sound outputs.Two years of transducer R&D work has culminated in our new, proprietary biosynthetic diaphragm horn and ultra-powerful 6mm dynamic coil. Our new driver utilizes a next-generation compound diaphragm manufacturing process combined with the strongest ever magnetic system within a nano-dynamic driver housing. The extremely responsive nature of our driver means the overall sound is full and detailed, unparalleled in definition with any other commercial wireless earbud. Our tuning process has ensured a balanced sound that emphasizes strong sub-bass impact, a natural mid-range, and clear treble. These features unite to deliver a design that immerses you in your music, the way it was meant to sound.To achieve the most coherent connection and user experience, the FLIGHT features the latest Qualcomm QCC3040 Bluetooth chipset. The latest iteration of its class, the QCC3040 can bring a more stable connection, support higher-quality music transmission, and improve sound quality performance - all while providing efficient battery management. With Bluetooth 5.2 capability, your phone calls can stay more stable, your games and videos are completely in sync with the audio, and you can enjoy a minimum latency experience.Having worked with numerous professional musicians and sound engineers, we understand that the perfect fit for an earbud is just as crucial as its sound. To guarantee a secure, comfortable fit for every user, we scanned and analyzed hundreds of ears and utilized algorithmic modeling to create a shell shape that best suits the average ear. Medical-grade resin is utilized for each shell for a comfortable and lightweight fit that can be worn for hours on end. Each unit is hand-molded, painted, and polished for the ultimate bespoke experience.FLIGHT is equipped with a 30mAh battery that can provide up to 6 hours of active listening per charge. Furthermore, each FLIGHT comes with a charging case equipped with a 200mAh battery that can extend the usage to 24 hours of active listening or 200 hours of standby time.The FLIGHT is also equipped with Qualcomm’s latest Clear Voice Capture (CVC) 8.0. CVC 8.0 is a noise reduction algorithm that effectively filters out background noise to reduce up to 30dB of unwanted ambient sounds during your phone calls. By accurately calculating the position of the caller in relation to ambient sounds, CVC 8.0 allows a pure sound transmission for cleaner and more audible calls.When FLIGHT is taken out of the charging box, it automatically turns on and connects to the last device used instantly. The super quick and efficient connection mode means less fiddling around on your phone to connect, and more direct listening time to your favorite music. To change or add a new device, simply touch the FLIGHT to easily pair.Capable of fast charge, just 30 minutes of charging can allow up to 24 hours of listening! To maximize the lifespan of FLIGHT, the device features a new overcharge protection battery cell, which means you won’t have to worry about your chargers growing shorter and shorter. And plan to not use the FLIGHT for some period of time? The FLIGHT can fully power off to minimize battery drainage and pick up right where you left off.The FLIGHT is IPX4 water-resistant, meaning it is safe to be used during exercises and light rain and splashes. Whether you are sweating away at the gym or commuting on an outcast day, the FLIGHT is ready to pump you up with your favorite music.Additionally, the Peacock Flight comes with three specifically designed ear tips for use with strenuous exercise - made with medical-grade silicone, these ear tips are ultra-light and safe on the skin. Combined with the custom ergonomic form factor of the shell, the Flight is snug and secure in your ears.  On top of that, we have also designed super-soft anti-irritant ear tips as the campaign add-ons that disperse inner ear pressures to allow long-duration uses without any discomfort to the ear canal.The new upgraded chip is widely compatible with mainstream Bluetooth-enabled mobile phones, computers, and tablet devices. You can easily and quickly pair and connect with any IOS, Android, or Windows device simply by taking the FLIGHT out of its case. It’s the immediate connection you’ve been waiting for!The FLIGHT is equipped with Qualcomm aptX™ capable to provide you with High-resolution sound. The aptX™ is one of the best Bluetooth audio codecs for a low-latency transmission. With one of the best latency and transfer rates (up to 24-bit 96kHz music quality wirelessly), aptX™ allows you to experience high audio quality with more efficient power management, lower delays, and better fault tolerances.We are proud of our beautiful and unique shell designs, which are only made possible by meticulously hand-painting each piece to create true one-of-a-kind artwork. The engineering and tuning process necessitates hand soldering and testing of each driver component to ensure the greatest precision and quality control. In 2018, Linsoul worked in conjunction with  Peacock to release Peacock P1. Continued with the success of Peacock P1, Peacock Flight lands on Kickstarter.We maintain a strong connection with Chinese HiFi brands in order to offer a curated selection of the very best that Chi-Fi has to offer.

Made in Canada, by Canadians.  We, somewhat, have a love/hate relationship with Winter.Graptors Studs are basically pliers, with teeth, on a stud. Like pliers, you press down on the handles to open up the jaw, which is held under tension from the C-shaped fulcrum. When you release it, it bites down on the material you’ve inserted, without piercing and/or tearing it apart. Keep your lawn covers safe and sound. Stop using heavy bricks and damaging nails, which tear it apart and mess up everything. You won't need to buy new lawn covers every year, Graptors Studs anchor them safely and easily. By Fall 2022, we will have the Graptors Studs available everywhere in Canada & America, to protect lawns like yours from Winter. Hi, I'm Etienne, from Quebec, Canada, founder at Graptors. I will be honest ; installing lawn covers used to sucks.In 2019, I was helping my mother install her lawn covers.And like every Fall season, we bought new ones, because the old ones were all torn up. They had so many holes that they weren't going to protect anything. We, then, put heavy bricks on them, and nails through them to try to anchor them to the ground, before the snow rolls in.Though, the wind would most probably mess it all up. We were going through that whole process knowing very well that next fall, we will start all over again, costing hundreds of dollars. It's a very wasteful cycle that only lawn covers manufacturers profits from.Last fall, I was wondering : is there a way for my mom to install lawn covers securily, without tearing them apart, that wouldn't require heavy bricks and damaging nails ? As it turns out, no. So I created Graptors.Wants more Graptors content ?

                "Title": "Quizlarm: Productivity Booster For the Better Future",
                "Text": "Hello, I am 18 year old high school senior seeking to launch my first app. Because of my age, I realize that backers may, rightfully so, be doubtful and consider it a huge risk, so I would like to start by telling my story before introducing Quizlarm.I have always been an ambitious person with unique goals and dreams. In middle school, I was into classical guitar. I remember playing for hours and hours every day to become what my school called a guitar legend. It was an award given to a student who finished all courses of classical guitar and performed 20 minute recital in front of the school. After 3 years of hard work, I made it. Then, during my Freshman year of high school, I invested tens of hours each week in my school's robotics club. This time, my goal was to make it the world's competition and compete in the international event. Working in hallways by the vending machine everyday, my team and I, for the first time in school history, made it. Then, in my Junior year, after robotics stopped due to the pandemic, I had my first part-time job. Making money for the first time, I studied economy from day to night. This time my goal was to create a sustainable financial asset portfolio composed of growth stocks, dividend stocks, and U.S. government bonds. Finally, in my senior year, I started a community recycling project with group of friends. We dedicated our time to make recycling easy for a community that did not recycle. We distributed 1000 advertisement flyers, trash bags to houses participating, collected the trash bags, sorted aluminums and plastics, removed all labels, and recycled every single items we collected. This time, my goal was to help my community to be more sustainable. I did not list my journey's to just brag and assure you that I am capable. Throughout these experiences, I've learned, what I believe, to be a valuable skills that can guide me through my journey with a Quizlarm project. Guitar journey taught me that diligence and hard work pays off motivating me to always work hard. Robotics taught me to be more efficient and attempt to calculate all the variables that can become risks in the future. Economic studies taught me to manage risks to reduce the chances of failure. Finally, the recycling project taught me execution skills. There will most certainly be hurdles, but I believe I am ready for the challenge.Have you ever had those mornings where you could not wake up? Did you ever miss alarms or used the snooze button too much? Have you ever felt that waking up is just a waste of time? It feels terrible waking up hours after your desired wake-up time, and it feels even worse to feel like you are wasting your time hitting snooze buttons after snooze buttons. I've had similar problems, so I am in process of creating Quizlarm, an alarm app that will guarantee that you wake up with productivity in mind. How?Quizlarm is an alarm app, and the app will give you a quiz each morning. The user will have to solve the question(s) correctly to turn off the alarm. In other words, the user will have to wake up and solve a quiz to turn off the alarm ensuring that the user wakes up. No more snoozes and no more waking up hours after your desired wake up time. Productivity?The app will most certainly wake you up, but how will it provide productivity users seek? Most of the quizzes given to the users will be pre-made simple questions that attempts to make the user think. For example, the app will ask users to spell certain words, copy certain motivational quotes, solve medium difficulty math problems, and etc. However, the user will have an option to create his/her own questions. I believe users are the ones that know themselves the best, and they are the only ones who knows exactly what questions to ask them. For example, if Eric has an important English test in a week, Eric can make questions that he needs to remember for the exam, or if Sarah has an important interview that she can not forget in few days, she can make a question to reminder herself of such an event. However, if the user does not have any important events, the app will simply provide the users with its questions. Alarm apps are something people use on daily basis, and if the app reminds you or teaches you an information every single morning, then I believe the user can greatly benefit. Not only will the user wake up on time, the user will start each day productively paving each morning to be the foundation of their success.Today, the app's initial UI and significant portion of development is done. However,  because the app is not aesthetically pleasing as of today, contracts with external UI designer will be underway in few weeks to improve the apps overall look. Further, because the app needs to connect to a server, I am planning to contact a developer to help me with the finishing touches of the app. According to current plans, the app will be ready to launch in late December or early January. I've included some screenshots from the app for your reference. According to the Harvard online resources in the science of learnings section, there is a quote, \"[information] is only kept [in the memory system] through constant repetition\" emphasizing the importance of repetitive learning. Further, according to the article \"Repetition and the brain: neural models of stimulus-specific effects\" written by departments in Stanford University, Cambridge, and National Institute of Mental Health, explains why and how repetition allows the brain to  stimulate a faster response with greater accuracy.  As such, it has been proven that repetition improves learning, and I believe repetitive learnings each morning can be an even greater catalyst than simple repetition. The first thing the user sees and experiences in the morning is what the user desires to memorize or learn. We are living in a world where the value of the financial assets are rising faster than the value of labor.  Also, the world's wealth gap is only increasing. The wealth gap between the highly educated and the non-educated population is reaching all time highs.  So, I think my app can attempt to help solve such a societal problem. I believe my app can help our society take one of thousands of step closer to solving our societal problems by providing repetitive learning each morning prompting the users to be more productive and wake up on time. Changes I bring may be small, but I still believe utilizing the wasteful time people spend waking up each morning can be a change in the right direction for our society.Receiving money should be followed by responsibility, so I will lay out how the funds will be used including how much I am investing in my project. Further, to ensure transparency, for some backers of my project, financial report will be sent that includes where and why each penny was spent.As the chart below shows, most of the money raised through Kickstarter will go to pay for external developer who specializes in server side development and UI designer to make the app more aesthetically more appealing. You may wonder if $2000 raised will be enough to fund such a project, but I will be also investing money that I've saved during my part-time job, this additional capital information will be included in the financial report. * The above budget is an estimation and it leaves room for error and taxes.I do not know how much money will be raised, but the exact dollar amount will be recorded and some backers will receive financial report to know that the funds were used to kickstart my project. Thank you for reading my story.

Agricultural products must be safe, healthy and traceable in order to make consumers truly reassured in the modern market competition. Therefore, digital farming consisting of LoRa Technology and the Internet of Things is solving the problem over how to feed a rapidly growing population across the globe.After the Covid-19 situation, we know that food sources is another concern that we need to be think about.This Smart Internet of things ( IoT ) system will monitoring the farm required information and then analyse data and will enable the farm to optimse the harvesting of crop.This pilot project focuses on collecting, reading and visualizing data acquired from several LoRa WAN sensors deployed in a crop health management solution as plants need to be protected from harmful weather conditions when they are still delicate and particularly prone to diseases.· Temperature Monitoring includes heat, snow, frost warning· Humidity Monitoring that control bacteria, viruses and fungi developed.· Sunlight Monitoring as photosynthesis is an important part of plant growing.ChallengeAs a matter of fact, what is fundamentally significant to smart farming crop health management is temperature, humidity and sunlight data (not saying other factors unimportant). However, it will be difficult to manually check data at times as weather conditions may continuously change during the day and also sunlight is changing accordingly.About the internet of Things system,The integration will need to take a bit of technical know how to integrate those sensors into the system. It will take a few months to get familiarize and set up.Step 1:  LoRa WAN gateway is installed on top of a nearby building with a great signal;\nStep 2: Temp/humidity and sunlight sensors are placed at equidistant locations within certain blocks and generate data;\nStep 3: LoRaWAN gateway collects data from sensors and pushes them to The Things Network platform every 30 minutes;\nStep 4: Users check data in visualized graphs on the application developed by Milesight (you can also use a third-party application server or develop your own application). These graphs are useful to farm operators to modify their corp health management system.Reduce CostBig money can be definitely saved on labor costs as this project will greatly decrease the number of farmers needed to monitor and tend the growth situation of plants and streamline their operations.Increase ProductivityFarm operators are able to adjust their plan of soil- and crop-specific fertilization and plant nutrition based on visualized information (temperature, humidity, water content, sunlight, etc.).About MyselfHi, I am Guan Hock Teo, My kickstart project will involve purchasing a set of IoT Agriculture set up kit, and set it up for trial and testing. The things network platform is one of the illustrated platform.  In the process, there are many steps and configurations needed to configure cloud and application server. This project will involve doing up a video clip and user manual , to guide the user how to set up their agriculture kit..Eventually linked up this agriculture kit to the network server and its dashboard.Kickstart funder will have the option of receiving the video clip and soft copy of user manual that I do up. They will also have the option to receive a Pledge to smart farming limited edition singlet.My linkedln profile is as follows:https://www.linkedin.com/in/teoguanhock/Appreciated & Thank you.",

                "Text": " Did you know that doctors recommend cleaning or changing the mask after each use?\nThis is true. According to Johns Hopkins University, you must cleanse or change the mask after each use. But who actually does it? You simply do not have time to quit washing every day, or change your mask several times during the day. By changing the mask, we increase the amount of waste, but we not always carry a spare mask with us and during the day we take off our mask more than once and put or hang up somewhere, thereby accumulating microbes and viruses in the object that protects us. In the face of the current pandemic, we have drastically changed our hygiene practices. You will see that more and more people care about the cleanliness of the surrounding air and things. As a result, we tend to carry more cleaning devices with us than ever before, and until now we have not seen anyone make a product that can combine all of these functions and make it more convenient. Therefore, we would like to present our new invention - Subleme Plus.Subleme Plus is a highly portable solution to your contaminated mask woes: - Pop it in  your pocket - Keep it in your car -  Put it with your masks at home - In the foyer - At the office -  Anywhere where you might need a mask!With concern about our health and the health of loved ones and relatives, we came up with a new device Subleme Plus. With the Subleme Plus we can safely disinfect our everyday items that we use so often.Microorganisms multiply by replicating genetic material in the nucleus of living cells, and ultraviolet light can alter and rearrange the helical structure of DNA / RNA, stopping cell division. And because our LED is in the range where DNA / RNA is most sensitive, Subleme Plus can perform better in cleaning than other products. Today, all microorganisms, including viruses and bacteria that have become resistant to antibiotics, are vulnerable to UVC rays.With the UVC LEDs in the device that radiate in the wavelength range of 200-280 nm, it ensures the sterilization of items such as masks, pens, keys, jewelry in a brief time like 10-20 seconds. The inside of our device has UV-C rays and it provides a sterile environment for storing the mask when we need to take it off. It is very easy to use, all you have to do is place your belongings, close the lid and press the button. After the process is completed, the light on it will turn off.Subleme Plus offers various advantages over the traditionally used mercury lamps and UV lamps. It is the most effective, environmentally-friendly, and chemical-free way to keep your things clean.Subleme Plus is fully rechargeable. Thanks to new technologies, one charge will last from 15 to 30 days of operation. And the microprocessor itself, which generates UV-C rays, lasts for 90,000 hours of operation without stopping. Subleme Plus is completely portable and easy to carry, you can put it in your shoulder bag or in your pockets, always protecting it from harmful microorganisms.This is not just a disinfection device, it is our health, a person close to us. The disinfection process is very simple and absolutely safe.Subleme Plus is made from a high-strength aluminum alloy that does not harm human health or the surrounding nature.Every year, more than 10 million tons of garbage get into our oceans and surrounding nature. We believe that waste reduction must come together to cope with the global pollution of our planet.Subleme Plus will be made with high quality and durable materials to ensure a long lifetime and to be a reliable companion on all your adventures, indoors and outdoors.We are ensuring recyclable by only using suitable materials for Subleme Plus and its packaging (solely cardboard and no plastic).The materials mentioned above are not only recyclable, but are in combination with the long lifetime also a sustainable choice. Where possible (e.g. packaging) we are not only setting a focus on sustainable materials, but also on reducing the use of materials as much as possible.Factories that we will chose for mass production will be carefully evaluated regarding compliance with environmental regulations. Emphasis will also be put on social conditions as health and safety, working hours, minimum wages, labor practices and discrimination.",

Let the party begin!We created an extremely rich expression system for Eilik in order to make him more lifelike, including laughing, yelling, crying, depressed, speechless, disappointed, cute, funny, wronged, cursing, angry, and so on. In addition, Eilik can express himself vividly thanks to dynamic animations and a 25 fps OLED screen. Our in-house animation team is hard at work behind Eilik's real-life expression to make Eilik more vivid and fun. Every action necessitates the coordination and cooperation of screenwriters, storytellers, animation producers, and voice actors, before being shown to Eilik by the software engineer.Regular updates are available via Eilik's cross-platform software, so that he will be smarter, get more expressions, and download more plot content. Every update will make Eilik a better bot for you. In order to make Eilik's arm and body more flexible and dexterous, we have designed a new servo motor especially. EM3 is 100% self-developed, from the gear layout, circuit board, to the control algorithm. Compared with the traditional 9g servo, the torque of EM3 can reach up to 3kg.EM3 can efficiently protect gears and offset external force with its overload clutch protection function. Position, voltage, temperature, and current feedback are all supported by the EM3's comprehensive control protocol, which uses a universal serial communication interface. Basic current-loop control is also available. A specific control and debugging software is also included with the EM3. We've cooperated with international carriers like FedEx, UPS, DHL, and USPS. Kindly note that the price above doesn't include shipping costs, taxes, or additional duties. COVID-19 is still delaying international shipping in many places, but things are better now, and we hope that by the time we start shipping, the delivery time can be back to normal. We will update you with the whole shipping process continuously.Energize Lab is an innovative startup focusing on robotics technology and products, including robot joints, control systems, servo motor, BLDC motor, and consumer robot. With our own patented robot technology and experienced animation experts, our team is committed to creating a robot with soul and endless fun.Our team is formed by a group of experienced engineers, designers, animators, and developers. As robot passionists, we have been working hard to make Eilik come true in the past two years, and we are glad that we have finally made it here. We chose to launch Eilik first here as we believe that this awesome community can give us more inspiration and incredible ideas. We look forward to having you as our co-creator, and let's make Eilik a better bot for everyone. ",

Whether you’re just not quite camera ready, a seasoned content creator, or simply inspired to change your look, the app empowers you to instantly transform your likeness and take full control of your digital narrative.Since its inception, xpression camera has been inspiring people around the globe to reinvent their image while chatting on apps like Zoom, live streaming on Twitch, or creating content on YouTube.In 2020, our team of engineers endeavored to create a foundational virtual camera platform that is not only entertaining, but practically useful in any setting and for anyone, whether you’re seeking a breath of fresh air–a much needed reprieve from the constant glare of the webcam lens during stressful work meetings, want to put your best face forward in an online class, produce intriguing video content for social media, pursue your own creative project, or chat with family and friends.What possibilities arise when you can be free of worry over a cluttered background, or not wearing make-up during your daily meetings?Or if you could appear in a suit on camera and in actuality be wearing pajamas?The app’s essential aim gives you the opportunity to reinvent yourself in digital form, and establish your footing within the technologically advanced world on our horizon.xpression camera's powerful and innovative technology also functions as a creator platform, supporting an array of meme, gif, cinematic, and social content generators throughout their journeys, from image and video sourcing to creation, with professional tools that help you produce original content to share with friends, business associates, and followers alike. Our 3D Dense Face Tracking technology is trained to recognize the face’s precise shape and expressions of the face while simultaneously honing in on over fifty thousand 3-dimensional points.Our Neural Rendering technology generates natural looking images modeled after the original. With xpression camera, the process of recognizing the source image and the user's face, as well as producing visual components is all done within 0.01 seconds, ensuring a real time in-app experience.We are developing technology that will allow users to animate images and videos using just voice or text recordings, which will introduce two new mediums through which you can create content while using xpression camera. These features will eliminate the need for users to utilize a web camera while they record themselves and allow for increased flexibility. So if you happen to be doing household chores, partaking in childcare duties, or even jogging, for example, you can still seamlessly enjoy the app.We are also developing technology that can control the movements of the entire body with the intent to integrate this feature into future versions of xpression camera. With the current app, only the upper half of the body can be manipulated, but we’re working towards giving users the ability to animate the movements of the entire body of the likeness that they present on screen.This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them. This project is powered by Kickbooster, the first and only tool made specifically for crowdfunders to manage their affiliate, referral, and influencer network all in one place.Our Ethical Commitmentxpression camera was developed by a team of pioneering engineers dedicated to promoting a healthy and imaginative community centered on AI driven content, because we believe in a future of unbound creativity, powered by deep learning.

The average person drives between 10,000 and 15,000 miles and spends between $1,300 and $1,900 on gasoline per year. In comparison, the cost of electricity to power Myriad over the same distance is up to four times lower. Over the six year average length of car ownership, that's between $5,500 and $8,200 in gasoline savings.We've assumed a fuel economy of 21 miles per gallon for a comparable gasoline powered premium sedan. We've also assumed the national average of $0.13 per kilowatt-hour for electricity, 10% charging on Tesla’s Supercharger network and $2.85 per gallon for premium gasoline over the next six years.Our first car will be a SUV with solar pannel roof. It will have a 2673 mm wheelbase, it will be 4500 mm long, 1650 mm wide , 1750 tall.It will be available in 2 configurations , one single motor with rear wheel drive and one dual motor with AWD.The single motor version will be equipped with 85 kWh battery pack and the dual motor with 100 kWh battery pack.The power produced will be arround 400 hp for the single motor and 520 hp for the dual motor.Now we are at the stage of merging the software and hardware together.We dont have a working prototype so we cant show it to you.We have renders of how we wish the car to look but we cant share them because of kickstarter`s policy. Maybe we will be able to add them in an update.Thank you!",

                "Text": "Kniterate is bringing an affordable and compact version of industrial knitting machines to your workshop. It automatically turns your digital designs into knitted garments.We’ve made the process of designing and making knitwear very easy. Start creating scarves, beanies, ties, ready to be worn and assembling your own dresses, sweaters or even shoes.Create a design and Kniterate will knit it for you. Our process makes it easy for you to scale from one-offs to production quantities. Read the section How Kniterate works for details.We love knitwear. It’s light and breathable, adapts to your body and unlike cut-and-sew, there is almost no waste, because the product is knitted to shape. We have developed Kniterate because we want everyone to be able to explore knitting’s potential. Until now the only similar tools available were industrial knitting machines, which cost upwards of $50,000, take a lot of space and require a technician to run. With Kniterate you can make personalized professional knitwear at the click of a button, and repeat and share your favorite designs over and over again.     Domestic knitting machines from the 80s work with punch cards and tasks like casting on, casting off, shaping, cable knitting, etc. can take hours of painstaking work -- and it only gets more complicated when you add colors.   Like an industrial knitting machine, Kniterate is computer-controlled. It can transfer stitches around and do these tasks automatically, freeing you up to do more creative work.Kniterate bridges both worlds with an easy to use automatic digital knitting machine adapted to suit the budget of makers and designers and sized for any studio, makerspace or class.  With a library of templates and up to six feeders (different colors and/or materials), you will be able to make amazing patterns, structures and shapes that would be hard to knit otherwise.           This is the perfect machine for small fashion businesses and design studios, makerspaces and schools.Its applications go beyond knitwear, ranging from medical devices and aerospace components to technical apparel and sports equipment. Imagine having a tool to prototype the new generation of wearables!With Kniterate, you can create custom knitted products like scarves, beanies, shoe uppers, sweaters, dresses, and more. Just follow these three easy steps:    .The Kniterate software is currently under development and will ship free with the knitting machine. There will be a browser-based version and a standalone version (Mac and Windows compatible), the files will be loaded onto the machine via an SD card or USB.An online library of templates will be integrated into the design app, so that you can design, edit and share your garments and accessories. The UI will let you:The design app in the video below is not fully functional yet. We show it as a way to demonstrate what we are working on.The design app shown in the video below is functional but still a bit rough around the edges. (A little steam will smooth out the wavy edges of the scarf).Capabilities that have been developed so far:We'll keep this list updated with our progress. We are currently working on the algorithms for shaping garments. As soon as the design app is more robust we will make it public to our backers only, for review and feedback.The design app generates a set of low-level instructions to run the the machine called K-code, that describe any set of operations it can undertake. The easy to use design app is able to output this K-code so you don’t have to worry about anything, it integrates seamlessly with Kniterate. Although, since it was designed to be readable and writable by a human, we are publishing its specifications here.   Our free software will allow designers, artists, illustrators and makers to grow our platform by sharing their work.You will be able to explore templates from your favourite designers and Kniterate will knit them for you.We can’t wait to start engaging with our community to build the best Kniterate experience. We wanted to make it easy for everyone to organize a way to reach more people and help them pledge for Kniterate. To do this we have created the Made in the Neighborhood program.  We have developed countless prototypes, and although the machine works perfectly and all the information we’ve given you is based on this model, we want to make a lighter and faster machine. That’s why we are giving ourselves four months to optimize it and test it before manufacturing.To manufacture Kniterate we have partnered with an industrial knitting machine manufacturer that has over 30 years of experience.The factory has thoroughly reviewed our design for manufacturing (DFM), Bill of Materials (BOM), as well as the production plan, giving us a quote and manufacturing times.Our target shipping date is April 2018.We will not charge your shipping during the campaign. Shipping prices vary by location and country. It’s simpler (and cheaper for you) to handle this separately and it allows you to spread the costs. It's also the most equitable way to treat each of our backers.After the Kickstarter is over and we are ready to start shipping, you will receive an invitation to go to our website and enter your shipping information to pay the appropriate amount.Gerard Rubio started this project four years ago and assembled a team which has worked tirelessly to bring you Kniterate.Barcelona, Spain At design school Gerard watched fashion students struggle with old knitting machines. Having worked building 3D printers years before, he had the idea for OpenKnit.  Gerard kept working on it and he made the project public in 2014 with the video below:Shenzhen, China  Gerard assembled a team and was selected for the HAX accelerator in Shenzhen, China to develop the machine. HAX is the first and largest hardware accelerator, and has one of the most selective programs in the world. Shenzhen is the electronics manufacturing capital of the world.                        In January 2016, we moved there with 14 other HAX teams. We spent four incredible months working hard to develop a Kniterate prototype to take to Maker Faire Bay Area.Zhejian, China  To make a machine that knits professional quality products and to deliver the rewards on time, we’ve partnered with a family-owned knitting machine manufacturer with 30 years of experience. We spent the summer of 2016 living in their factory.By merging our team’s energy and creativity with the operational excellence of a Chinese industrial knitting machine manufacturer, we will be able to work with confidence in delivering the rewards of this campaign.Gerard Rubio holds degrees in Film Direction and Media Design. He co-founded blablabLAB, an art collective. Two award-winning projects developed during that period, Be Your Own Souvenir and Haberlandt, took him to numerous conferences and exhibitions around the world. You may remember him from OpenKnit.Triambak Saxena worked as a molecular biologist, with research published in the field of plant science. This was before he decided to study finance and practice the craft of the spreadsheet at Kniterate. He had previously collaborated with Gerard in blablabLAB.Tom Catling has a background in 3D printing and scientific instrumentation. He met Gerard and Triambak whilst doing a PhD at UCL, and has also worked as a hardware designer with several other Kickstarter and open source projects.Jinhee Park graduated from the Bunka Fashion College in Japan and is currently studying fashion knit in the London College of Fashion. As an intern in Kniterate she helped design much of the knitwear at Kniterate.Héctor Anadón Héctor made his first 3D printer even before starting his degree in Aerospace Engineering. He hasn't stopped shipping new things since then.Daniel Carmona has a background in Aerospace Engineering and 3D printing software. He is now a FullStack web developer.  We didn’t do this alone. We would like to thanks to all of you for making this possible: We have spent many hours developing Kniterate and are now ready to move into production. To make this happen we need your support. A pledge of any amount, however small, will mean a lot to us: We can’t wait to offer you the means to create and share your own customized knits. We know you are going to come up with ideas that we can’t even think of, and we are really excited about it!We will be updating our FAQ here and in this spreadsheet.Kniterate.com",

We completely redesigned the experience of observation by opting for the most comfortable eyepiece: your mobile device combined with our app. You can now access the wonders of the Universe with ease.Thanks to Vespera, you can explore and observe the night sky, capture your own photos of celestial objects, learn about the Cosmos, and share your discoveries all in one place.Super easy to use, just set up the tripod using the adjustable legs, and press the button. Let Vespera come to life and calibrate itself through the GPS of your device and our Star Field Recognition technology. Using the app, select the object you want to observe, and Vespera will point and track it. Even charging Vespera is as simple as this: Our app is your space center, the place where you decide where you want to go. Very intuitive and user friendly, you can easily access any stellar object in our catalog.You will also get personalized recommendations on what to observe according to your geolocation and the astronomical calendar.You will beguided each step of the way on your journey to reach the stars.Have you ever dreamed of photographing the Cosmos? Vespera integrates the technology allowing you to observe and shoot deep-sky objects effortlessly. You can now memorialize galaxies, nebulae and so much more.Here’s what you can do with Vespera. Equipped with the best components on the market, Vespera is a gem of technology.Quadruplet Apochromatic RefractorThere are two kinds of telescopes: reflectors (mirrors) and refractors (lenses). Mirrors need to be adjusted very often when refractors keep a perfect alignment during all their life. To avoid any optical default, we developed our home made optical design based on 4 lenses in 2 groups. This system is one of the best on the market: 0 distortion, 0 chromatic aberration, 0 astigmatism. Vespera guaranties you the sharpest stars for many years and the perfect optic to follow you wherever you go! Sony sensorThe latest Sony sensors have an incredible sensitivity in low light. That is the reason why we chose them to provide the best sensor for Vespera. However, a sensor is not enough. We developed our own electronic card to make sure that heat management stays optimal. A hot sensor means a lot of defaults, so our sensor board is designed to dissipate the maximum amount of heat.Image processing algorithmLike our previous product, we worked in partnership with the Raspberry Pi computer manufacturer to guarantee you the best software & hardware performances. We embed the last Raspberry Pi technologies, working with our patented image processing algorithm to get the best of the Sony sensor.Our team of engineers are working all year long to provide regular software updates to always offer the best product on the market. In Vespera, several million tasks are processed between the moment the lens captures the starlight and the moment you see it on your mobile device.  AutofocusAs with any kind of photo, the focus is crucial in astronomy. The outside temperature changes during the night, so we developed the only astronomical instrument with autofocus that adjusts automatically for the entirety of your observation.Designed for wanderers, Vespera is the lightest and smallest smart telescope in the world. So tiny, it can fit in your backpack. Weighing less than 5 kgs, you can bring it with you everywhere to explore new places, and live even more unforgettable moments. We are proud to share the same passion as two legends of Space Exploration. Scott Kelly, former astronaut, pilot of Discovery space Shuttle, holds the record for the longest stay in Space in one mission. He also worked on the Hubble telescope. Terry Virts was commander of the ISS, and has the around-the-world speed record in 47 hours.\"I felt completely connected to the universe and I hope with Vespera, you can experience some of that feeling too\". Scott Kelly.\"It's really a breakthrough, it's really a gem of technology I've never thought of until Vaonis made this amazing device.\" Terry Virts.Because this project couldn't exist without ❤️Agnès, Audrey, Benoit, Christophe, Cyril, Adrien, Nora, Gilles, Joy, Maxime, Mehdi, Mihai, Remy, Stéphanie, Thomas and Yann.  ❤️Thanks to APF, our manufacturer, and Ova design agency, our council design agency, Vespera's project went from drawing to reality.Together, we're ready to press the START button!A big thanks to L'Imagerie Films for their amazing work during this campaign.  ",

We'll recommend exercises that encourage improvement as well as retention of learned skills.HAPTIC FEEDBACK Nothing is going to replace the feeling of playing behind an acoustic drum kit but our new virtual drum kit will bring you closer. Haptic feedback (similar to what you feel with a game console controller) creates a unique sensation based on which drum you hit and how hard. We’ve done this by recreating the vibrations you feel when playing an acoustic kit.HEEL UPOne of the most requested features from our customers is the ability to play the bass pedal with your heel up: increasing your speed and comfort. This will work for single bass, double bass, and the hi-hat.CUSTOM GRIP STYLES  In our app you will be able to select your preferred drumstick grip style for both left and right-handed playing: intelligently re-calibrating the drumstick sensors to meet the ergonomic grip of your choice.It's our mission to make Freedrum compatible with as many devices as possible. As our name suggests, you should be free to use our product in a way that suits you best. Please refer to our FAQ for a full list of supported devices. Since Freedrum is using interactive audio, Bluetooth headphones and speakers have an inherent latency that makes it difficult to play. Please refer to our FAQ page for more information.Thanks to you, the community, our first virtual drum kit reached over 400% of the Kickstarter goal and we delivered our rewards, on time, 9 months later. Since 2017 we've shipped 15 000 units globally and we've listened to all of your feedback. We're back, four years later to ask for your help once more.

                "Text": "UDOO Neo  embodies a new concept: a single board computer suitable for the Post-PC era:Two years after the launch of UDOO, we are back! With UDOO we created a new playground for students to learn the basics of coding and electronics. Designers use UDOO as an artistic platform to build digital installations, interactive museums or new musical instruments. In these two years, Makers have hacked cars, built 3D printers and Android robots—all thanks to UDOO. Startups, businesses and research groups have prototyped Lunar Rovers, and augmented reality applications for museums and multimedia smart home applications. \nWith UDOO Neo we want to take it one step further. In the next five years, connected devices will outnumber the global population, and we will be living in a whole new world of automatic interactions between smart objects: this is the Internet of Things. We designed UDOO Neo as the platform to bring you into this new world.Most Makers start with Raspberry Pi or Arduino™. We love them both, so we designed UDOO to merge these two worlds into one powerful solution. With UDOO Neo, we decided to take our bet further. \nBecause we share the vision that a computer is not just a screen with a keyboard: it is a toolbox for hacking the world and building daring creative projects.UDOO Neo offers a new paradigm in the single board computer landscape: from homogeneous to heterogeneous processor. \n\nUDOO Neo embeds two cores on the same processor: a powerful 1GHz ARM Cortex-A9 and an exceptional 166MHz Cortex-M4 I/O real-time co-processor on the same chip, the Freescale i.MX 6SoloX. This is a heterogeneous processor.UDOO Neo is born to be wireless, featuring both a powerful Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n and a Bluetooth 4.0 module - Classic Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy - to connect to nearby objects, smart and mobile devices like speakers, microphones, tablets, smartphones, smart watches, beacons, cameras, smart trackers, headphones, NAS devices, smart TVs, smart cars and many other wireless devices. \nUDOO Neo also embeds Wi-Fi Direct Smart Config. How does it work? It’s very simple: you connect your UDOO Neo to another device via a P2P connection, regardless of whether you have a wireless access point or not. Finally, with UDOO Neo you can always rely on fast ethernet RJ45 (10/100 Mbps).The Internet of Things is here, all around us. From smartphones to wearables, from smart appliances to M2M applications, sensors are everywhere, and bring a world of data about moving things into the online realm. UDOO Neo embeds 9-axis motion sensors (accelerometer, magnetometer, digital gyroscope) directly on the board. This way, you can build a drone that automatically adjusts to a perfectly stable horizontal position if there is wind. Or connect it to your motorbike and measure your riding skills, using it as a smart tracker for motorbikes.   The only limit is your creativity!Not to mention the compatibility with analog sensors. Temperature sensors, potentiometers, light resistors and many others sensors are analog, and most other boards are only compatible with digital sensors.UDOO Neo is a credit-card sized single board computer: our current prototypes are 59.3mm x 85mm (3.35\" x 2.33\"). UDOO Neo is indeed a pocket computer. Bring it with you wherever you go. Simply attach it to the USB port of your computer to power-it up. Alternatively, you can use an external battery to power it up, like you would with your smartphone.Otherwise, just attach it to a 12v power supply, a mouse and a keyboard through its USB ports or to your tv/monitor through the micro HDMI port, or LVDS touch display. We designed UDOO as an easy product to get started with. On UDOO Neo, thanks to the powerful Cortex-M4, you can run Arduino™ sketches using the standard  Arduino™ IDE. UDOO Neo is compatible with all the sketches, tutorials and resources available from the Arduino™ community. On UDOO Neo, thanks to the efficient Cortex-A9, you will be able to run both Android and Linux, and just by switching the SD Card, you can shift from Android to Linux in a flash. The UDOO Neo Kernel will be based on the Linux Kernel 3.10. We are developing a dedicated Ubuntu-based distro for UDOO Neo, like we did with UDOObuntu for UDOO. Since UDOO Neo is an open-source hardware project, we will release u-Boot and kernel sources. With the help of the community, we will release other distros in the following months, as we did for UDOO with XBMC, Linaro Ubuntu, ArchLinux, Debian, Yocto Project, Volumio, OpenMediaVault, Debian Wheezy armHF and Open Elec.  UDOO Neo supports Android Kitkat 4.4.3. It will be a Vanilla Android: an Android version without any customization, in order to allow you to fully customize.You will also be able to install Google Apps like Google Play, Chrome, Google Now, YouTube and so on. \nUDOO Neo is the perfect platform to program in the Cloud due to its unprecedented connectivity. However, we won't force you to use a proprietary cloud service. You can program locally, without staying connected or relying on proprietary servers. Or you can program in the Cloud. \nThere are several open-source solutions online you can already use to program in the Cloud through UDOO Neo.When we designed UDOO, students and teachers were our first concern. Students deserve a quick and smart solution, while teachers need something interactive and easy to teach.UDOO Neo helps classrooms approach subjects like electronics, computer science, robotics or interaction design.Regardless of whether you're an expert or a beginner, UDOO Neo is the perfect tool for both beginning and advanced programming skills. On UDOO Neo, you can indeed write in any language you  already know. On our website, www.udoo.org, you'll find many step-by-step tutorials, structured for different levels of expertise, from beginner to advanced. If you are interested in electronics, UDOO Neo is also an exceptional starting point to start tinkering and get experienced with Arduino™ and circuitry. You can take any Arduino™ project from www.arduino.cc and build it on UDOO as if it were a wireless Arduino™!UDOO is already collaborating with many schools, like the Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, USA, ETH Zurich, Switzerland, MS Ramaiah Institute of Technology in Bangalore, India, University of Siena, Italy, the Sarrocchi Institute of Technology in Siena, Italy, and Malignani Institute of Technology in Udine, Italy, by giving students the chance to gain experience developing software, open source hardware and Internet of Things applications. Around UDOO, a vibrant community is growing and growing.  UDOO Neo, like UDOO, is an open-source hardware product, so all the schematics, gerber files and the BOM (bill of materials) will be available for hacking when the board is released. Being open-source is crucial to supporting our community. Thanks to its flexibility, UDOO Neo allows you to re-create any Arduino™ or Raspberry Pi projects you want.Each day, UDOOers meet each other in our forum, and exchange points of view and details about their current projects. We are proud of our community and the projects it has realized in these two years.UDOO is the result of a joint effort between SECO and AIDILAB. SECO designs and manufactures each product in the UDOO family. Relying on SECO means relying on a manufacturer with over 35 years of experience in the single board computer field, with an in-house manufacturing unit that has been an ISO9001 certified company since 2003. AIDILAB is an Interaction Design Lab of artists, designers and engineers focused on nurturing the UDOO community, building software and hardware applications for the UDOO family and spreading the open-source philosophy of UDOO around the world. Timeline\n\n So far, UDOO Neo has been developed as a rev A prototype. We are already working on the rev B prototype, figuring out the strengths and weaknesses of the model and experimenting on both the hardware and software sides. As soon as this prototyping step is finished, we will release UDOO Neo rev C to beta testers.        ",

We've been absolutely blown away by all the support we've received from this incredible community and couldn't be more grateful. Pledge at the $5 high five level to join our backer community and you'll be the first to get notified about when our next batch of Shine units become available.In the meantime,  feel free to check out our awesome Shine accessories that are still available:HOW DO YOU POWER YOUR OUTDOOR ADVENTURES?Do you use portable power banks that die in a few hours,  solar chargers that rarely create usable power or bulky power stations that are hard to pack and heavy to carry?It’s time to ditch these. It’s time to use clean,  efficient wind energy to power your devices!The Shine Turbine is the ultra-compact, highly efficient, portable wind charger that lets you use the wind to rapidly create your own power to charge all your handheld devices - from your phone to your camera - anytime, anywhere the wind blows.From exploring coasts to navigating plains to scaling mountains, all you need to do is set up Shine and in under 2 minutes, you’ll have a wind generator to power your adventures. Charge phones, tablets, lights, cameras, and more with this small but mighty 40 W turbine. Power gear in real-time during the day or night, or rapidly store energy for later use with Shine’s internal 12,000 mAh Li-Ion battery.As CEO of A for Adventure, Chris promotes outdoor adventures through videography, photography, consultation, book readings and more. His team is based in beautiful Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.Access to renewable power off-grid is essential as electronics often require more charging power than portable batteries can provide. Without a reliable energy source, you can find yourself in vulnerable situations when your battery supply can’t be replenished.Whether you’re camping, canoeing, RVing, hanging at a cottage, or looking to prepare for an emergency, the Shine Turbine provides renewable power day and night, rain, cloud, or shine.Shine’s patent-pending technology instantly converts wind into power to charge a variety of devices or rapidly stores energy in its internal 12,000 mAh battery for later use. Plug a USB cable into Shine to power devices while the turbine is in operation or stowed. Plug your phone into Shine while at basecamp, or pack Shine up and continue to power devices while the turbine is stowed in your pack.This 40-watt ultra-compact wind charger can power any handheld USB device, including phones, tablets, lights, drones, cameras, GPS, speakers, e-readers, headphones, power banks, and more.Shine creates energy faster than any other handheld renewable product. It is able to collect three phones' worth of power in an hour at maximum rated wind speeds.Shine is for anyone who wants to charge handheld devices while disconnected from the energy grid. The turbine is perfect for keeping electronics charged while backpacking, camping, RVing, fishing, hunting, remote working, and more. Use Shine to charge just about any handheld device including:Use a USB-A power cord to charge your devices while at home, at camp, or on the move.HERE'S THE TIME IT TAKES SHINE TO PRODUCE THE POWER TO CHARGE POPULAR DEVICESShine’s high-efficiency blades and patent-pending technology allow it to rapidly create and store energy faster than any other handheld renewable energy product. The table above shows the power Shine will generate between the lowest and highest wind speeds the turbine can operate in. Even at 8 mph, which is hardly any wind with leaves on trees slightly moving, Shine will create usable power to trickle charge its internal battery. The turbine will generate large amounts of power in high wind speeds up to 28 mph and rapidly fully charge its internal battery.WIND SPEED MAP OF NORTH AMERICACheck out the open source Global Wind Atlas to see what kind of wind speeds you can expect to find at your favorite camping locations across the globe!PRO TIP: Hit up your campsite using the search bar on the wind map and click \"10\" meters on the bottom right  side bar for the most accurate wind speeds for Shine!START WITH THE WINDWind flows over the turbine body causing Shine to automatically turn into the wind. The wind turns the blades on the rotor which spins its generator, allowing its internal battery to charge.POWER ANYTIMEPower your device while Shine is in operation or stowed. No need to wait for a full charge, you can use your device while connected to Shine. And when it’s time to hit the trail, stow Shine in your backpack pocket and run the cable to your device for on-the-go charging. Shine is built for the rugged outdoors. Its monopod is made of highly-resilient 7075-T6 aluminum, its motor mount is made of aircraft-grade 6061-T6 aluminum, and its blades and body are made of injection-molded PC-ABS material.The Shine Turbine team has been developing the product since 2018 and has overcome countless technical hurdles. These ranged from optimizing the pivot point to face Shine into the wind, to fitting everything needed to set up the turbine inside its internal compartment, to its patent-pending turbine design that provides portability without sacrificing efficiency!SHINE GETS MORE POWER FROM NATUREShine’s major differentiator is its power generation efficiency. When it comes to generating high amounts of energy quickly, the wind wins! This is because the wind has a cubic relationship with power.Shine works on the cubic output of wind. That means as wind speeds double, Shine’s power output goes up eight times. This, paired with Shine’s high-efficiency blades and lightweight design, allow it to produce the most amount of energy for the least amount of weight compared to any other comparable portable renewable charger.What does this mean? Your new portable turbine is more efficient than other comparable wind turbines, river turbines, solar panels, and battery packs on the market!EVERYTHING NEEDED TO USE SHINE STOWS TO THE SIZE OF A WATER BOTTLEShine features an extremely compact design. The size of a water bottle, it can easily find a home in your pack's side pouch. Everything needed to set up the turbine stores inside its internal compartment, and its blades fold onto its body to make it 100% self-contained.The team behind Shine are all avid outdoor enthusiasts and have experienced the typical issues that come with portable solar chargers. At this size, solar panels are only about 5-10% efficient, especially if the sun is not directly above the panel. Meaning if there’s cloud, if it’s nighttime, or if there’s dust or dirt on the panel, very little power is going to be generated. Shine’s ability to provide energy at any time of day, in all different weather conditions, makes it a much more dependable source of power.Check out these \"Shine-y\" add-ons to use with the Shine Turbine and on your outdoor adventures!

                "Text": " Instagram | Facebook | Twitter | Press pack Hi! We are QUBS, a Swiss company, and we’re launching our first educational toy: Cody Block! Cody Block is a Montessori inspired, screen-free wooden toy for children 3+, introducing the basics of computational thinking through tangible programming.It’s a busy city! Go on adventures with Cody, help him find his way home by driving through the cityscape one block at a time! Create and learn the basics of coding, it’s hands on programming!Cody Block introduces the first concepts of computational thinking to young children via tangible programming. Your task is to lay out a path that leads Cody back to his house by positioning the Building Blocks in a correct order. Each Building Block gives a unique directional command (turn left, turn right, U turn, repeat last command, stop, record path, play path), together they create a sequence of instructions (the basis of any algorithm). Here is a short video showing a Cody in action.  In this video, Cody is going Left, Left, then makes a U turn to finally reach his home and stop!Cody Block comes with the City Guide, a story book with several exercises & adventures providing different learning outcomes.Children can play with Cody for hours without the need of any smartphone, laptop or screen. We have developed a specific RFID technology (patented!) that is embedded in every wooden block. Cody Block has been designed with gender equity in mind, it is as much fun for boys as for girls. Also, there are no written information on the toy, it’s ready to play even if your child does not read.The design of Cody Block takes its inspiration from classic wooden toys and the Montessori philosophy in its material and shape: solid beech wood and intuitive design. We intentionally did not incorporate light or sound, and there are no visible electronics. Just a moving car driving around the city blocks. Your city can be as big as you want, the Building Blocks can be set 20  cm, 50 cm, 1 meter, 10 meters apart! It’s all up to you and your imagination! And there are no limits to how many blocks and Cody car you can play with!In this digital age it is important to empower children to be creators and not only passive users of new technologies. The current generation of children will need to be literate in technology in order to understand the world they live in. Understanding how computers work and learning the basics of coding will not only help children to learn logical thinking but also to develop fundamental problem solving abilities, creativity and resilience. Learning these skills from an early stage creates a natural tendency to assimilate this content in a more efficient way. Cody helps introducing coding concepts to the little ones. But what will they learn? And how?Algorithm: An algorithm is a set of rules that define a sequence of operations. When children lay out the Building Blocks for Cody to follow, they are actually giving the computer rules on how and where to move.Sequencing: Sequencing is the specific order in which instructions are performed in an algorithm. It is important that the steps in an algorithm are performed in the correct order - otherwise the algorithm will not work. In the same way Cody follows the order of the Building Blocks: if one Block is misplaced or there’s a gap in the sequence, Cody will go in the wrong direction.\n\nDebugging: Mistakes in code are called ‘bugs.’ Debugging is a process that includes identifying the problem and then correcting it. Because the Building Blocks are tangible and arranged on a surface for the children to see, it is easier for them to spot the mistake in their code and debug the program.Function: A function is a part of code that can be called by another part of the program. With Cody, kids can create a function and record it with Cody. Cody will remember that function and perform it again in the code every time he encounters a “Play Function” Block.Logic: Learning the thinking behind coding teaches children how to tackle large problems by breaking them down into a sequence of smaller, more manageable problems. This logical thinking skill is a powerful tool that can be used in every field and in real life too! We chose to create a tangible programming language that kids can actually touch with their hands, following the Montessori proposition that kids learn best by experiencing the environment around them. The Cody Block set comes with:  Cody always drives in a straight line and only changes direction or stops when it faces a Building. You can’t drive without a driver, so to turn Cody ON, simply snap his head and body together (we are using magnets!).There are 7 different Buidling Blocks, each gives a specific order to Cody. Each Cody Block set comes with 16 Building Blocks in total.Here is an interview from Bruce Lamont, a primary school teacher and a Lead Teacher in Zurich with 32 years of experience: You might wonder how Cody detects the instruction commands from the blocks. We are not using any camera recognition. Instead we are using a piece of technology called RFID (Radio-Frequency-Identification). In short, it consists of an antenna (inside Cody) emitting an electromagnetic field in order to detect a tag (inside the blocks) with a unique identification. RFID is commonly used in the industry (contactless payment, door pass, etc.) but it was a challenge to develop that technology to meet Cody Block requirements. We are very proud to say that our use of RFID technology in Cody Block is patented! And don’t worry, the radio frequency we are using is of course safe for your children. The other advantage with RFID technology is that it means Cody only needs batteries to power up (4 x AA batteries). It works straight out of the box. No Bluetooth, no Wifi required. The Building Blocks are literally just a wooden block with a little tag embedded in it.Cody Block has been designed by Studio Oscar Lhermitte, a multidisciplinary design studio based in Paris & London. The studio developed the product with these factors in mind: being playful, intuitive while at the same time being a beautiful little wooden toy with a life of its own. All the illustration work was created by the talented illustrator, João Fazenda. We hope you love it as much as we do! As well as thinking hard about the way Cody Block looks and feels, we’ve spent a huge amount of time on the engineering side of it. The mechanics, electronics & software development were engineered by Studio Christophe Machet and Studio Peter Krige, respectively. QUBS is a Swiss company, but our team is all over Europe!We are a new company, Cody Block is our first toy and we have big ambitions with it. We are launching it on Kickstarter because we want to raise the necessary funds to start the production of the first batch of 1 000 units. We have done extensive work development on it and are asking you to join us in this journey from now until production and fulfillment. We are also very eager to build a community of early adopters, get feedback and learn from you so we can develop Cody Block even better. Several of our partners/collaborators have had extensive experience with Kickstarter and they all told us it was clear to them that Cody Block should be launched on Kickstarter.We have our manufacturer secured and have pricing agreement with them. They have been behind several successful products that were launched on Kickstarter and they have done extensive work on toys in general. The funds raised on Kickstarter will go towards:We are aware of the complexity of manufacturing a product and delivering it to the backers. We are confident we have built the right team with the best expertise.

We've built a new way to keep up with the things you care about.Use Tidbyt to check the weather, or when your train is arriving. Track your favorite stock tickers, or your Dogecoin holdings 🐶  Browse our steadily growing collection of apps and choose what matters to you.Tidbyt comes in a solid walnut enclosure and looks pretty great on your desk or bookshelf. Set it up once with your phone, and it stays updated through its own Wi-Fi connection. Tidbyt can display pretty much anything, as long as it fits on the screen. Here's what we've got or are working on so far:We're always adding more features. Let us know what you'd like to see and we can work on it! And if you'd like to add stuff yourself, you can write a bit of code to push new things to the Tidbyt through its API. Every Tidbyt is unique, and with the Tidbyt app, you can schedule what you want to see and when. Your subway stop every morning? Got it. Your calendar throughout the day? Done.Tidbyt will cycle through the apps you select, one at a time. They can be scheduled to run at different times if you wish, or all at once. And if you want to keep it by your bed, Tidbyt's Night Mode can make the display go ultra-dim so it doesn't bother you while you sleep.Here's a quick demonstration of how all of this works—You can choose multiple apps to be displayed on your Tidbyt at the same time. It will cycle or rotate through, displaying each of them for either 5, 10 or 15 seconds (you pick). Easily cycle through multiple stock tickers, time and weather in different cities, multiple subway stops, a bunch of fun messages, or all of the above.Tidbyt lets you schedule apps to only be shown at certain times. Use your phone to choose what you want displayed and when.Tidbyt can get really, really bright if you want it to! But sometimes that's not what you want, so we built some great ways to control how bright your Tidbyt is.Adjustable BrightnessUse your phone to adjust the brightness of your Tidbyt.  Choose the brightness level that works best for the room your Tidbyt is in, whether it's in a basement or right next to a window.Night ModeKeeping a Tidbyt by your bed? Then Night Mode is for you. Choose your bedtime and we'll make the display very, very dim so that it doesn't bother you while you sleep. We also turn off all your normal Tidbyt apps and just show a simple clock, in case you wake up and want to know what time it is.Follow the Sun With auto-dimming, Tidbyt automatically adjusts its brightness as the sun rises and sets. It'll remain at your selected brightness level during the day, and gradually go dimmer as the sun sets in the evening.We built Tidbyt to be an open platform, so you can build your own applets and experiences for your Tidbyt. If you can write a bit of Python, then Tidbyt gives you super powers.With our existing API and SDK, you can build your own in minutes. Write whatever you'd like and push it to your Tidbyt to be displayed instantly.Later this year, we'll be launching a platform for any developer to publish new apps for Tidbyt. In fact, some early Tidbyt owners have already been coming up with fun new uses for their devices:If you're more of a hardware hacker, you can plug into our open hardware to customize your Tidbyt even further.  We're building a firmware development kit that you can use to build firmware and customize the functionality of your Tidbyt down to the very last byte.Early last year, we quit our jobs to start building Tidbyts in our workshop, and shipping them out as part of a pilot program. We assembled them by hand, and shipped them to friends, family, and other early adopters. Here's what some of them have had to say. You can also check out our community, where several of our users have been suggesting new features and discussing their own DIY app ideas.The feedback we've received has been invaluable, and we've improved the product quite a bit during the year. Now, we're scaling up our manufacturing to produce enough Tidbyts for everyone. We've partnered with a factory that can produce Tidbyts by the hundreds, though we need to place a large enough order to kick things off. With your support, we're hoping to do just that.Tidbyt is ready to go — we've tested out our manufacturing process, built the software, and successfully shipped units in our early access program. Based on this, we believe that it will take about 8-10 weeks to manufacture a batch of Tidbyts. We're also building in some additional time because the American walnut hardwood we're using is in very high demand and our supplier has a backlog.We'll then be bringing the Tidbyts from the factory in Shenzhen to the USA, for final shipping and delivery. Due to shipping volatility during the pandemic, the import & delivery process can take as long as two months. Given that, we're estimating delivery in September (though we'll definitely try to do everything we can to deliver earlier, if it's possible).🇺🇸  We'll be shipping using UPS and USPS from a US warehouse. We expect most backers in the US to receive their Tidbyt within 2-3 days of it being shipped.International deliveries will be sent duty unpaid. This means that if you are ordering a Tidbyt outside the US, you may owe duty, VAT, or other taxes, based on your local regulations. These taxes legally have to be paid when you receive the package, or it may be returned to us or even destroyed 😟 Note that there may be minor changes to the specs as we ramp up production. In particular, the exact dimensions of the enclosure may differ a bit.To set up and configure your Tidbyt, you'll be using our smartphone app, which requires iOS or Android.Tidbyt, Inc., was founded in early 2020 by Rohan and Mats, who both quit their jobs to focus full-time on this nifty little idea. The two met in 2011 while working for Spotify in Stockholm, Sweden, and currently both reside in Brooklyn, New York.You can find our Press Kit over here.Our campaign video was produced by the very talented people at FnA.Our creative and brand design was done by Hea Jin Ko.For web design and marketing help, we couldn't have done it without Aiko Takemura.We got a lot of amazing advice and help planning our launch from the friendly folks at Launch Studio: ",

                "Text": "How does it work? The Solar Cow – one of Time Magazine’s top 100 inventions of 2019 – is a solar charging system installed in schools in rural off-grid areas in African countries, with a current focus in Tanzania. Solar Cows allow kids to charge portable batteries, called Solar Milk, while they attend class and take them home at the end of the school day. It becomes valuable source of energy for charging parents' cell phone and light at night.Many low-income families rely on kerosene lighting and relatively expensive charging stations to meet their energy needs, this green electricity is a tangible incentive for them to send their kids to school instead of work. The energy budget of the average Kenyan household takes up to 15% of their monthly income, so saving money on electricity is a great benefit. Meeting families’ short-term energy needs also helps them to break out of poverty in the long term by providing kids with an education, creating fundamental change in their lives. Education enables people to improve their own lives, instead of relying on external assistance.  YOLK developed a custom charging socket that is only compatible with Solar Cow charging systems so that parents must send kids to school in order to charge their battery. This also helps to prevent misallocation of the batteries for other uses. For our Kickstarter backers, we will send Solar Milk that can be charged through regular USB-C so you can use it at home.Backers will be able to access the PDF file for a certificate of Wocralos on Dec 24th. You can share the story with your loved ones about your special gift for them.Changing the world for the better seems like a daunting task but Solar Cow is here to make it just a bit easier. How great would it be if kids can go to school and enjoy more days full of fun with their friends? Thanks to Solar Cow,  now they even have power to play songs and dance together~!!! What’s more, backers who select the Give + data option will be shown data on kids' charging of their Solar Milk. Each battery given to kids in Tanzania has a unique ID code, which the Solar Cow records every time it is used. This allows supporters to see the real impact of their purchase for a better world. With Kickstarter funding, we will be able to launch this very new project concept to track the impact of Solar Milk and Solar Cows. Delivering individual and real data of users in Africa directly to backers is something that no other project has yet tried.YOLK has received widespread media coverage and several awards for Solar Cows, including from Time Magazine, an innovation award from the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), and placing in the top three at the Green Tech Awards, all in 2019. In 2018, we also won the aid innovation challenge at AidEx, as well as the iF Social Impact award. Our grants and partnerships include the P4G Partnership Award, the Korea International Cooperation Agency Creative Technology Solution Program, and a partnership with Energy4Impact.Solar Milk is a handy light and power bank that anyone can use. It makes an excellent night or flashlight, with four hours of bright light per charge, or six hours of soft light. It can also be used as a power bank to charge cell phones.Remember, as well as giving power to your phone, Solar Milk is also designed to empower kids in Tanzania to go to school. When you buy a Solar Milk battery and light for yourself,  you can also buy the same device for a child in Africa. While you can charge Solar Milk using a USB-C charger at home, African kids charge them at special solar charging systems, called Solar Cows, which are installed in schools.Easy turn on/off and mode change between mood light and torch.  This bright little gift tells a story of love. Share the Solar Cow story with family and friends.Our two prototype tests, in Kenya and Tanzania, proved so effective in increasing African kids' attendance rates, it was almost as though they were brought to school by magic!\"I was particularly impressed by the increased attendance and retention rates that the Solar Cow initiative achieved [at a pilot project in Tanzania]; the increase in students' study time; and, the environmentally friendly nature of the  Its feature could enhance the results of UNESCO's own initiatives.\" -Tirso Dos Santos, Head of Office and Representative of UNESCO TanzaniaThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarter launches with 1,400+ successful Kickstarter projects and over $500M raised in total.About YOLKYOLK, the creator of Solar Cows, is a US and South Korea-based solar technology startup in the business of creating a symbiotic world through innovation. Nowadays, technology is evolving rapidly. However there are still so many people who are left out. For an example, there are 1.3bn people using Kerosene oil for light, which creates toxic emissions that are not only harmful to their health but also contribute to climate change.  What if we support people in developing countries to live better lives? Solar Cows can make the world a better place, not only in terms of the environment but also in terms of warmth and love. Team members YOLK founder and CEO Sen Chang is an award-winning designer whose recognitions include the iF and Red dot design award.

                "Title": "Zcapture - Open Source 360 Product Photography",
                "Text": "My goal with Zcapture is to provide a low-cost, high-quality product that can be modified, hacked or customized to fit individual needs. We believe this product should be shared with the world in a manner that is disruptive to this emerging industry of 360 driven content creation, shows a better way of doing things, and provides information in a user centric medium.I have been deeply involved in web development for 15 years and a great majority of that time has been focused on eCommerce development and design. In that time I have always found that the lack of meaningful product information is a killer when presenting a product in a meaningful way to have them purchase. Couple this experience with being a hard core maker that has been publishing articles for the last decade and there was bound to be a merging of ideas.The humble beginnings of Zcapture came from my own personal interest in experimentation about 8 years ago with Basic Stamp programming. Roughly 4 years ago I discovered the Arduino NG and fell in love with the Arduino platform from the point of view that anyone could learn it and use it. Immediately I set to work to build and refine the Zcapture system based on this robust platform. You can learn more about out mission and features in depth at our websiteAs a maker I have always been challenged with providing enough detail for a project guide while being able to see a project through to completion and publication. As the web has evolved the expectation of the user for better and better content has increased with the capability of browsers and web coding technologies.Coupling this concept with ecommerce and product information sites is a potent mix that is becoming more and more common. Leading the pack is Google and Wal-Mart venturing into the 360 product visualization sphere because of one simple reason, it sells. With the ability to see the product online and virtually handle it, people are more confident in their purchase and more likely to buy from a vendor with rich media.We’ve been able to produce the perfect system that rivals emerging competing products in the marketplace by coupling open source hardware design with the innovative application of technology, software, engineering, and above all creativity.This KickStarter is step one on a journey for us that ultimately leads to a boxed product that we would like to see be at a price point and availability that would enable anyone to be able purchase one. In our ideal situation we would like to see people using this to list products on auction sites, classifieds ads, and especially in the maker community to showcase their projects.The Zcapture system consists of three tightly integrated components: Hardware, Software, and HTML. These three systems allow you to easily go from item to website in as little as 15 minutes. The design and functionality of each system has been designed to be as easy to implement as possible with intuitive controls so that just about anyone can setup, connect, and shoot amazing 360 shots.While developing the Zcapture hardware platform, we went through several revisions. We wanted to produce something that was strong and robust while still staying cost-effective and reliable. This refining process has often been tumultuous because we are constantly adding new capabilities, features, and functionality to the system. At the same time, we are focused on producing something that will meet most people’s needs. This hardware platform has been designed to work 100% autonomously without the need to be connected or controlled from a computer or can be connected for a more seamless user experience within the Zcaptue software suite. It also has features like optical isolation from your camera equipment and active cooling to ensure cool and stable operation. We have created a more powerful and enjoyable product to use through changes. With the refining process including multiple versions and predecessors we were ultimately led to a refined, simple, and powerful hardware design that is user-friendly and both easy to use and maintain.The Zcapture software suite has been designed as a professional tool to give everyone the ability to create exceptional 360° product photography for the web. This suite of tools allows you to rapidly edit, crop, re-size, customize, preview, export, and upload your images in the least amount of time possible. If you have any experience using products like Adobe Photoshop or Light Room, then the Zcapture software suit will be intuitive and easy-to-use. We have worked very hard to remove all the hard work from the process for you.The Zcapture image processing suite version 1.0 is a powerful toolset for producing 360 rotating product imagery designed for use and display on the web. With both advanced features for advanced users and easy editing tools for the novice, anyone can start creating 360 content for the web without wasting precious time or money.Most important of all, Every supporter on KickStarter will get access to LIFETIME FREE UPDATES. Yep, that’s in all caps because it's so cool. Each time we release a new version your license key will allow you to activate the latest version for free. This is critical for supporting the next browser version, technology or device platform out there. The Zcapture system is stunningly easy to use. With 6 simple steps you can go from product to website in as little as 15 minuets per item. If you have even basic photography skills you will be able to produce excellent quality imagery to embed on your website. Simply connect power, the controller, and your camera to start shooting right away without messing around with complicated settings.The Zcapture is compatible with most SLR cameras that support a external shutter control. However, it works natively with all Cannon and Nikon Camera models out of the box. When you place your order we will have a survey at the end of the KickStarter to find out what model of camera you will need to support. For the base KickStarter we will only be supporting Canon and Nikon Cameras. We will set some stretch goals with more camera support and even adding in a IR header to support most point and shoot cameras. For a full list of supported cameras check out our compatibility list.With the optional funding level option your iphone, ipod and ipad can be used as the camera for the Zcapture system. This cable will support all apple devices with cameras iphone, ipad, ipad mini, iphone.Check out our portfolio for some inspirational ideas and great looking examples of what the Zcapture system is capable of at our Websites Examples.Makers will love how easy Zcapture is to use. Gone are the days of a project build with static photos. Now instructions can be step-by-step in 360, allowing the reader to see all the intricacies of your project. Even better is the ability to show off your project complete and polished. Imagine shooting your item in 360 and listing it in an auction or classifieds site. Or building something out of Legos that you want to save and share? Perhaps you want to show off something new you just purchased on Facebook? There are millions of uses for Zcapture for anyone from hobbies, artists and even the stay at home mom and is only limited by your imagination.One of the ideal situations for the Zcapture system to fill a daily business need will be in eCommerce. eCommerce is constantly evolving and changing to engage customers and help them feel confident with making purchases online. With the growth in the eCommerce sector exploding there is a greater need to show a product online in a way that leads to a conversion and differentiates a site or seller within a market place from there competitors.The Zcapture system has been designed with the ability to upgrade it as new capabilities and needs evolve. Whether you need to upgrade your micro-controller to newer version or compatible variant or replace the motor with a more powerful one, there are several options to increase the capability of your system.We have a lot of future functionality in mind for the Zcapture system. As part of this vision we have added several headers and ports on the actual circuit board to allow for all sorts of functional upgrades to the system that anyone can tinker with. And with an Arduino at its heart modifying code and tinkering is super easy!As part of the launch of the Zcapture system we will be introducing community forums to share, teach, and support each other as we launch this product line. We will regularly be publishing articles with information on many associated topics from lighting and camera setup to evaluation of third party apps and platform support. Our goal is to share and contribute all our experience and encourage the same.Tee Shirts!$25 - You will get one of our snazzy Tee Shirts in your size.

We will upgrade every unit to a more powerful motor and a larger chassis to hold it. This will enable the unit to work with larger loads and allow a higher degree of accuracy.The mini and pro units are exempt for this stretch goal. If you want a larger more capable motor back the pro model as it has a nema23 motor already.We will develop a library of IR codes for the Zcapture system, allowing it to control your camera's shutter via an infrared header. PLEASE NOTE: This will be an evolution over time as we add to our library of IR codes. This feature will only support cameras that accept IR input.What does the future hold for Zcapture? We are already working to develop a handful of complementary services and features to assist the creative process and distribution of the Zcapture system.The Zcapture platform is a functional prototype that is\nbeing prepared for production and mass distribution. Your support in this early\nprototype is appreciated. Bear in mind that there may be issues with hardware\nand software associated with a prototype. Cloud based content hosting\nOne of our goals is to create a system where Zcapture system users can upload their shots directly to our own content delivery cloud. This will make things like integration, embedding and hosting of content a breeze to work with. Our goal is to have this service launched in Q2 of 2014The retail pushOne of our biggest goals is to create a version of the Zcapture system that is affordable enough that it can be distributed and sold as a boxed product. Making this type of software and hardware solution available to everyone will help us with our goals of adoption and creating a solution that is disruptive to this emerging industry.A little about the inventor\nJared Bouck is the inventor, designer and creator of the Zcapture system and related Rotate 360 Studios that offers 360 photography services utilizing Zcapture technology.

This is Jared's second KickStarter after successfully completing his last one. He is an avid inventor and creator, designing products, kits and projects for the DIY community to share and invites others to participate in all his projects.ManufacturingAll of our manufacturing will be done in house using our own manufacturing equipment that we already own. Our large laser cutter will be put to work to produce the chassis and disks for the system. We have an injection molding company on standby if we hit our stretch goals.Circuit boards are sourced from overseas with backup manufactures here in the US. Component parts are sourced from Newark and mouser with motors and power supplies directly from the manufacturers. We have 4 dedicated staff members to help handle assembly and shipping. We have 100 complete systems already sourced and we are front loading already. After reaching our half way point of our original KickStarter for this project we realized that we may have over reached with our funding goals and focus on using this KickStarter solely to reach our goal of a retail ready product. With this said we have decided to cancel our original kick starter and re-launch it with a more appropriate funding goal to insure all of our great backers get the opportunity to actually end up with the product in their hands. After presenting this plan to the community and getting overwhelming support to move ahead with it we decided to prelaunch and we are excited to present this back to our backers to insure they get to play with this amazing platform. Thanks to everyone's support and feedback to make this a successful re-launch.",
